# Calculate Customer Retention Rate and Segment the customer

**Goal of the project:** Using the OnlineRetail data to calculate Customer Retention Rate and Segment the customer by their RFM score to understand the customer insight as well as improve the marketing strategy 

### **Project Summarization:**
  To achieve the goal of the project, I went through several steps:

**Step 1: Understanding the data**
- Cleaning: removing the data with negative quantity(return products)
  - Calculate Revenue by month
  - Analyze the number of active customer and number of order
  - Analyze the new customer ratio and retention rate
 
**Step 2: Doing the Customer Segment**
- In this step, I used two different techniques to segment the customer
    - RFM techniques (Recency - Frequency - Money value)
    - K-Means: machine learning technique to segment the customer by clusters
  
By segmenting the customer, we could extract or filter the most valuable group of the customer to nurture and retarget via digital marketing channels of the company. For example, employing their profile as the input to retarget on Facebook ads or sending them the personalized message (top 5 similar products that are frequently bought by the purchasers on the identical segment) in the email campaign.
