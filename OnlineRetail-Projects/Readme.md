# Calculate Customer Retention Rate and Segment the customer

**Goal of the project:** Using the OnlineRetail data to calculate Customer Retention Rate and Segment the customer by their RFM score in order to understand the customer insight as well as improve the marketing strategy 

### **Project Summarization:**
  In order to achieve the goal of the project I gone though the severals steps:

**Step 1: Understand the data**
- Cleaning: removing the data with negative quantity(return products)
  - Calculate Revenue by month
  - Analyze the number of active customer and number of order
  - Analyze the new customer ratio and retention rate
 
**Step 2: Doing the Customer Segment**
- In this step I used two different techniques to segment the customer
    - RFM techniques (Recency - Frequency - Money value)
    - K-Means: machine learning technique to segment the customer by clusters
  
By segment the customer, we could extract/filter out the most valuable segment to nurture and retarget via digital marketing channels of company
