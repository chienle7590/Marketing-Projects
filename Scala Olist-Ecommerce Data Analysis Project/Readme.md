In this project, I recoded the Spark Olist Ecommerce Data Analysis file from PySpark (written in Jupyter Notebook) to Scala script.

Conclusion: Writing and running spark jobs in scala as a script is more efficient in terms of speed. However, there are some issues or differences that need to pay attention to:
  -How to config with sbt with Spark dependencies
  -The difference in syntax or file structure such as the main function
