# Text Classification and Topic Modelling 
> An effort to classify the text to the right classes ( InfoTheory, CompVis and Math) and modelling the topic from the text.

## General info
The purpose of the project is to compare different machine learning models and neuro network model performance in the task of classifying the class of the text and in modeling the topics that the text indicates. Besides, improving the skills while dealing with Natural Language Processing tasks.

## Text Classification
In this part, I did the data preparation and trained the data by using 3 different neuro network models: simple RNN, LSTM, FastText versus 3 machine learning models namely Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, RandomForestClassifier, and comparing the performance between them.

## Topic Modelling
By using the gensim, and nltk package, after going through many text pre-processing steps such as tokenization, lemmatization, etc. I could visualize and figure out the topic mentioned through the text in the documents.
