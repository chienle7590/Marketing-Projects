# Text Classification and Topic Modelling 
> An effort to classify the text to the right classes ( InfoTheory, CompVis and Math) and modelling the topic from the text.

## General info
The purpose of the project is comparing different machine learning models and neuro network models performance in the task of classifying the class of the text and in modelling the topics that the text indicate. Besides, improving the skills while dealing with Natural Language Processing tasks.

## Text Classification
In this part, I did the data preparation and trained the data by using 3 different neuronetwork models: simple RNN, LSTM, FastText verus 3 machine learning models namely Logistic Regeression, Linear SVC, RandomForestClassifier and comparing the performance between them.

## Topic Modelling
By using the gensim, and nltk package, after going through many text pre-processing steps such as tokenization, lemmatization etc.. I could visualize and figure out the topic mentined through the text in the documents.
