    "   **Summarization**: In this part, I did the data preparation and trained the data by using 3 different models: simple RNN, LSTM, FastText. However, since the essence of LSTM, the trainning time is significantly long so I stopped the trainning execution and focused on training RNN and FastText with different combinations of hyperparameters. For example, using trainned vector such as glove.6B.100d, glove.6B.30d, embedding dimension = 100 or 200, however the training and validation loss of RNN and FastText with the different combination is quite similar. Then,I moved to employ different type of Optimizers.\n",

    "    Training and validation loss of FastText is remarkbly high after 1 or 2 epoch( over 90% - when training with Adam) - so I reduce learning rate and use less epoch to avoid overfit\n",

    "   **Conclusion**: FastText seems powerful for this classification task, more efficient compare to LSTM and RNN (similar training time to RNN but with lower loss).\n",

      "[' Canberra\\n has experienced its worst air quality on record, as bushfire smoke \\nbecame trapped by atmospheric conditions and residents were told to stay\\n indoors and brace for more smog in the coming days.   The ACTas \\nacting chief health officer, Dr Paul Dugdale, said the smoke was the \\nworst since the 2003 bushfires and was acertainly the worsta since air \\nquality monitoring started in the city 15 years ago.   Air quality \\nindex readings in Canberra city were at 3,463 on Wednesday afternoon, \\naccording to the ACT Health website. Ratings of more than 200 are \\nconsidered hazardous. The suburb of Monash showed levels at 4,650 and \\nFlorey was at 3,508.   An ACT health spokesperson said the AQI \\nreading for fine particles peaked at 7700 at 1am on Wednesday at the \\nMonash monitoring site.   The Canberra-based University of NSW \\nclimate scientist Dr Sophie Lewis was out in the city with her \\ntwo-year-old daughter and said the conditions were alike nothing I have \\nexperienced beforea. She was planning to leave the city.   aItas permeating everything. It is the fine particulates that get through everything. This is the worst it has been,a she said.   aLast night it started to blow in and you do start to feel quite anxious and stressed. Smoke just makes us all panic.a   Families\\n and children visiting Questacon, the National Science and Technology \\nCentre, had a look of shock, said Lewis, with many people wearing masks \\nand checking phone apps for air quality and fire updates.   Current\\n location: Questacon. Heaps of young families trying to escape the \\nsmoke, but itas inside too. Everyone has this dazed, nearly \\npanic-attacking face. Canat imagine the fear and anxiety for all who \\narenat safe  #AustraliaBurns   #ClimateEmergency    She said a pattern in recent weeks had been for the smoke\\n from bushfires burning to the east to arrive on cooler sea breezes in \\nthe evening.   On Tuesday night and Wednesday, a phenomenon known as\\n a atemperature inversiona had caused warmer air above to trap the \\nsmoke, making conditions especially bad.   The Bureau of Meteorology was expecting a similar temperature inversion to cause further problems in the ACT on Wednesday night.   On Wednesday morning Dugdale said 12 people had gone to Canberra hospital with smoke-related illnesses in the previous 24 hours.   Dugdale said it was not the time for people to start any new year fitness resolutions and they should stay indoors instead.   aThis is an exceptional time for Canberra a usually our air quality is among the best in the world,a he said.   The\\n ACTas health directorate also issued fresh advice on Wednesday, saying \\nall Canberrans should aavoid physical activity outsidea.   The public was advised to stay indoors with windows and doors closed and to turn evaporative air conditioners off.   The\\n aextremely thicka smog was forecast to linger for several days, with \\nconditions expected to remain poor, and temperatures on Saturday \\nforecast to climb to 42C.   A statement said: aWe also strongly \\nadvise people who are sensitive to smoke, especially those with \\npre-existing heart and lung conditions, to take extra care during these \\nconditions.   aPeople who are sensitive to smoke and air pollution \\ncan be more vulnerable to heat-related illness as well, so staying \\nhydrated and cool is important.   aPeople who are able to do so, are\\n also encouraged to check on others who they think might need extra \\nhelp, to see that they are okay.a   In NSW on Wednesday, the air \\nquality index was at very high hazardous levels of 2,300 around \\nGoulburn, caused by smoke from nearby bushfires.   Hazardous \\nconditions were also detected in regions of Sydneyas south-west (352), \\nand in the central tablelands (394) and southwest slopes (360).  ', '     As\\n dawn broke over a blackened Australian landscape Sunday, a picture \\nemerged of disaster of unprecedented scale. The Rural Fire Service said  150 fires were active in the state, 64 of them uncontrolled .    Weather\\n conditions eased, but more than 2,000 firefighters continued to fight \\nthe deadly fires that burned an area nearly the size of West Virginia in\\n southeastern Australia.   For the first time in Australia\\'s \\nhistory, 3,000 army, navy and air force reservists have also been called\\n up and will be thrown into the battle against the fires.   Prime \\nMinister Scott Morrison announced the decision Saturday and committed \\nalmost $14 million to lease four fire-fighting aircraft for the duration\\n of the wildfire crisis.   A mass of hot air moving across the \\ncountry brought extreme heat and strong winds to New South Wales and \\nVictoria on Saturday. Cooler and less windy conditions were expected on \\nSunday.     As many as 140,000 residents, in addition to tens of thousands of tourists, have been ordered to evacuate.

(PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)    Victoria\\n Premier Daniel Andrews advised residents to leave and declared a state \\nof disaster for six local government areas and Alpine resorts. It\\'s the \\nfirst time the emergency powers  have been used in Victoria , news.com.au reported.   New\\n South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has declared a seven-day state \\nof emergency starting at 9 a.m. Friday because of the ongoing crisis.   Across\\n Australia, 23 people have died. The latest were killed on a fire on a \\nhighway on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia. More than \\n1,400 homes have been destroyed in bushfires since October. Dozens of \\npeople are missing. More than 200 fires are burning in Victoria and New \\nSouth Wales, Australia\\'s two most-populous states.   Tourists\\n in New South Wales on Thursday were ordered to leave a \\n5,400-square-mile zone running from Nowra to the border with Victoria. \\nResidents of the area have been told to be ready to leave.   It is \\nthe \"largest mass relocation of people out of the region that we\\'ve ever\\n seen,\" NSW Minister for Transport Andrew Constance said.   The fires have closed dozens of roads, and officials urged drivers to stay on the main highways.   The\\n Rural Fire Service said Emergency Services have started escorting \\nvehicles on the Princes Highway between Milton and Nowra. The trip, \\nwhich normally takes about 45 minutes, took six to seven hours.   About\\n 30 miles south of Milton, evacuees around Batemans Bay struggled to \\nfind fuel, and long lines formed at gas stations. Power outages also \\nprevented stations from pumping gas.

(SAEED KHAN/AFP via Getty Images)    People looking for food and supplies lined up outside shops, some of which were only allowing a few people in at a time.   Authorities said 381 homes had been destroyed on the state\\'s southern coast this week, the AP reported.   \"These\\n fires have already caused significant damage. They\\'ve caused \\nsignificant loss, and our community needs to act now,\" Abbott said, \\naccording to news.com.au.   The HMAS  Choules  arrived off \\nMallacoota on Thursday morning to evacuate people who had gathered on \\nthe beach as bushfires surrounded the town on New Year\\'s Eve. About \\n4,000 people are thought to be in the town.   One local official \\nsaid people wishing to drive out of Mallacoota with their own cars could\\n be stuck for weeks because of road closures.   Data released \\nThursday from the Bureau of Meteorology show 2019 was Australia\\'s \\nhottest and driest year on record. December was Australia\\'s hottest \\nmonth on record. The average maximum temperature for the month was 101.3\\n degrees Fahrenheit, 7.47 degrees above the 1961-1990 average.   Smoke from the bushfires has blanketed areas far from the blazes.   In Canberra, a woman died Thursday night after disembarking from a flight from Brisbane  onto a smoke-filled tarmac , the New Daily reported.

', ' Your baby\\'s brain and body grow a lot during the first six months. \\nWhile every baby develops at their own pace, experts say they should be \\nhitting the below key milestones by month.   Until\\n birth, babies have spent their entire lives in the quiet, darkness of \\ntheir mother\\'s womb. So, from the time they\\'re born to about one month \\nold, they\\'re extremely sensitive to light and sound.\\xa0   They will likely  respond \\n to lights, sounds, and faces by moving their gaze in the direction of \\nthe stimulus. In fact, most babies will just stare around a room, says  Atul Malhotra , a neonatologist at Australia\\'s Monash University.\\xa0   As the muscles in the baby\\'s  neck  develop, you should start to see them  hold their head up  for very brief periods at two months of age.\\xa0   Your baby might have smiled in their sleep or while passing gas before this time, but they\\'ll have their first deliberate,  social smile  around their second month.\\xa0   A baby will also start to pay attention to faces and  calm themselves  by  bringing their hand to their mouth . Malhotra adds that infants should start cooing or making other basic sounds at month two.\\xa0   At 3 months old, your baby\\'s  muscle coordination ,  taste buds , and  social skills  have grown, which means they can roll to the side, express disgust at unpleasant tastes or loud noises, and  vocalize when spoken to .   Chuckling and batting away objects also begins around this age.\\xa0   By four months of age, your baby should  like to play with people  and  copy movements or facial expressions .\\xa0   Bearing  weight on the legs  and  propping themself up on their elbows  occurs around this time as well, says Malhotra, thanks to their ever-growing motor skills and muscle strength.\\xa0   A baby\\'s depth perception and color vision  are more fully developed  by this age and they\\'ll start to recognize and form attachments to their caregivers.\\xa0   They\\'ll also start to  respond to their name  and put their arms out when they fall.\\xa0   Your child should  sit without support  and make both  consonant and vowel sounds .\\xa0   They\\'ll also begin  fearing strangers ,  understand the word \"no,\"  and know  to respond when someone stops talking . Eating  soft solid foods  starts around this time too, Malhotra adds.\\xa0   \"In\\n my opinion, the most important milestones are smiling in response to \\ninteraction, head control in a variety of positions, and turning towards\\n sounds,\" Malhotra says.\\xa0   Your baby could be a late bloomer when it comes to smiling or lifting their head, but the CDC recommends  acting sooner \\n rather than later should children miss milestones. If your child isn\\'t \\nhitting the proper milestones around the recommended time, consult the \\nchild\\'s pediatrician or your family physician. And if you still don\\'t \\nsee progress soon, consider asking for a referral to a developmental \\nspecialist.

But there have only been a few studies into its effect on bone health and results have so far been inconclusive.     In\\n the latest paper, researchers from\\xa0the Barcelona Institute for \\nGlobal Health looked at 3,700 people between 2009 and 2012.

Experts believe it weakens bones through the same mechanism.   The tiny particles speed up the ageing process and people's bones naturally become weaker as they age.   Previous studies have also linked\\xa0 pollution to low levels of parathyroid hormone, which regulates calcium production, leading to more fragile bones.     Researchers took measurements of\\xa0PM2.5 and black carbon in the atmosphere in each village.\\xa0     PM2.5\\n is the finest type of particulate matter, while black carbon is a \\nlarger toxin.

The groundbreaking energy storage is made possible by ditching lithium-ion  batteries \\xa0a\\xa0used in everything from iPhones to pacemakers a\\xa0and replacing them with lithium-sulfur batteries.   Theoretically, lithium-sulfur batteries are capable of holding up to five-times more energy than  lithium-ion ones , but until now they have been wildly impractical for use in consumer electronics.   Sharing the full story, not just the headlines   The biggest challenge until now with lithium-sulfur batteries has\\n been the instability of the cathode, which undergoes a 78 per cent \\nchange in size each time it goes through a charge cycle.   This means the batteries degrade extremely quickly and do not last long enough for them to be recharged over and over again.     \\n left \\n Created with Sketch. \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n right \\n Created with Sketch. \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    Researchers at Monash University in Australia discovered that \\nusing a very flexible cathode\\xa0allowed it to handle the expansion \\nand contraction without significant degradation. In doing so, they claim\\n to have created the \"world\\'s most efficient\" lithium-sulfur battery.   aThe world needs radical new\\xa0 energy storage \\ntechnologies to fight climate change,a Dr \\nMahdokht\\xa0Shaibani\\xa0from Monash Universityas Department of \\nMechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who led the research, told\\xa0 The Independent .      aLithium-sulfur batteries, which use extremely \\nhigh-capacity sulfur, can store five-times as much capacity as \\ntraditional lithium-ion batteries, and are made from cheap materials \\nthat are available worldwide.a    Associate Professor Matthew Hill added: aThis approach not only \\nfavours high performance metrics and long life cycle... it is also can \\nlead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste.a   The research, which is published in\\xa0 Science Advances , could be a major milestone for the battery industry and could impact everything from consumer electronics to solar grids.   Dr Shaibani\\xa0said the commercialisation of the batteries may \\nbe between two to four years away, and a\\xa0patent for the \\nmanufacturing process has already been approved.   Prototype cells have been developed in Germany and further \\ntesting in cars and solar grids is set to take place in Australia this \\nyear.   aCost projections and performance metrics of our technology \\npredicts for outperforming todayas lithium-ion batteries at high \\ncompetitive price points,a said Dr Shaibani.\\xa0   aAltogether, this means that solar power could be much more \\neasily stored, or an electric vehicle go a lot further, but more \\nimportantly, the battery is safe, simple and ethical.aa  ', ' Scientists\\n have discovered a specific protein that triggers allergic reactions \\nwhen it comes into contact with fragrances common in cosmetic \\nproducts.\\xa0\\xa0   It can send immune cells into overdrive when people use skin creams, body washes, lotions, shampoos - and even toothpastes.   The\\n breakthrough could help stem soaring cases of rashes, lumps, blisters, \\nitchy eyes and facial swellings. It has been dubbed the \\'molecular \\nmissing link\\'.   An average woman uses 12 cosmetic items a day - containing an estimated 168 different chemicals.   And\\n as these products become increasingly common, scientists have noted \\nthat contact dermatitis - a kind of allergic reaction that causes a red,\\n itchy rash skin touches certain substances - has also been on the \\nrise.\\xa0   Contact dermatitis has been on the rise as the \\nskin care and cosmetic industry has grown. Now, scientists understand \\nhow common fragrances trigger a protein to cause the rash\\xa0   The\\n key protein, called CD1a, is found in immune cells that form the outer \\nlayer of human skin. It offers hope of developing drugs that block it.   Experiments\\n showed it binds directly to allergens, or irritants, found in personal \\ncare products - triggering the immune system\\'s T cells.   These \\nwhite blood cells kill foreign invaders. Allergies stem from mistaken \\nidentity, when they respond to benign substances that would otherwise be\\n harmless.   Co senior author Professor David Branch Moody, of the \\ndivision of rheumatology, inflammation and immunity at Brigham and \\nWomen\\'s Hospital in the United States, explained: \"What we present here \\nis a molecular missing link.\"   Compounds found in skin creams and other cosmetics can cause ACD (allergic contact dermatitis), he said.   The common condition is on the rise, particularly in industrialized countries. But the exact reasons remain unclear.   Most\\n allergies involving T cells are attributed to proteins or synthetically\\n produced peptide antigens that set off the immune system.   But \\nchemicals found in personal care products are different kinds of \\nmolecules that were not thought to be able to directly elicit a \\nreaction.   The latest findings, published in the journal Science \\nImmunology, uncover the way in which components of everyday consumer \\nproducts do just this.   They shed light on the mystery behind the rise in cases of ACD, say the international team.   Prof\\n Moody said: \"We questioned the prevailing paradigm that T cell-mediated\\n allergic reaction is only triggered when T cells respond to proteins or\\n peptide antigens.   \"We find a mechanism through which fragrance can initiate a T cell response through a protein called CD1a.\"   Dermatologists\\n have been puzzled for years as to how allergies are triggered by many \\nsubstances found in soaps, cosmetics, fragrances, jewellery and plants.   The\\n molecules were thought to be too small and of the wrong chemical \\nstructure to be detected directly by T cells - the immune cells that \\nfuel ACD.   Co study leader Dr Annemieke de Jong, a skin \\nimmunologist at Columbia University, New York, and colleagues wondered \\nif there might be another explanation.   So first author Dr Sarah \\nNicolai, MD, a research fellow in medicine at Brigham, exposed T cells \\nto material from skin patch testing kits used in allergy clinics.   This showed they responded to certain substances including balsam of Peru - widely used in cosmetics and toothpaste.   The\\n researchers further identified ingredients within the tree oil - benzyl\\n benzoate and benzyl cinnamate - that were directly responsible for \\nstimulating the reaction.   They also tested similar substances and found a dozen small molecules that appeared to elicit a response.   These\\n included farnesol - an alcohol used in a host of products including \\ndeodorants, anti ageing creams, shower gels and shampoos.   Using \\nscanning techniques, further analysis by investigators at Monash \\nUniversity, Melbourne, revealed farnesol and CD1a combine to destroy \\nnaturally occurring blood fats. This makes the protein more visible to T\\n cells - helping to activate them.   The researchers now plan to see if patients commonly have T cells that recognise molecules like farnesol.   They\\n also seeking new molecules that could block the response of CD1a and \\noverride the activation of T cells. Work is currently underway to \\nidentify promising compounds.  ', \" WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- An international team identified how \\nchemical compounds in creams and cosmetics cause rashes in the skin, \\nsuggesting a new way to treat the allergic condition.   The study published this week in the journal Science Immunology \\nshowed that an abundant molecule on the immune cells in the skin's outer\\n layer exposes those chemicals to T cells that orchestrate the immune \\nsystem's response to foreign chemicals.   Why some chemicals trigger dermatitis was a mystery, since small \\nchemicals have to bind to a larger protein in order to become visible to\\n T cells, but few chemicals do this by undergoing a chemical reaction \\ninside our body.   Researchers at Columbia University, the Brigham and Women's Hospital,\\n Cardiff University and Monash University found that several common \\nchemicals known to trigger allergic contact dermatitis were able to bind\\n to molecules called CD1a on the surface of skin immune cells and then \\nactivate T cells.   The chemicals include Balsam of Peru and farnesol, which are found in\\n many personal care products, such as skin creams, toothpaste, and \\nfragrances.   CD1a molecules bind the skin's own naturally occurring lipids in its \\ntunnel-like interior. Those lipids protrude from the tunnel, creating a \\nphysical barrier that prevents CD1a from interacting with T cells, \\naccording to the study.   Farnesol, however, was shown to hide inside the tunnel of CD1a, \\ndisplacing the resident natural lipids, making the CD1a surface visible \\nto the T cells and resulting in an immune reaction.   The discovery offers a new idea for treatment as the allergic \\ncondition might be stopped by applying competing lipids to the skin to \\ndisplace those triggering the immune reaction.   \", '    Published:    16:26 AEDT, 5 January 2020     |    Updated:    20:16 AEDT, 5 January 2020        Australian\\n bushfire smoke has delivered orange skies to New Zealand, prompting \\nstreet lights to turn on and a flood of calls to emergency services.

Source: Bureau of Meteorology    \", \" WASHINGTON, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Jan, 2020 ) :An \\ninternational team identified how chemical compounds in creams and \\ncosmetics cause rashes in the skin, suggesting a new way to treat the \\nallergic condition.    The study published this week in the journal \\nScience Immunology showed that an abundant molecule on the immune cells \\nin the skin's outer layer exposes those chemicals to T cells that \\norchestrate the immune system's response to foreign chemicals.    Why\\n some chemicals trigger dermatitis was a mystery, since small chemicals \\nhave to bind to a larger protein in order to become visible to T cells, \\nbut few chemicals do this by undergoing a chemical reaction inside our \\nbody.    Researchers at  Columbia  University, the Brigham and  Women 's Hospital,  Cardiff \\n University and Monash University found that several common chemicals \\nknown to trigger allergic contact dermatitis were able to bind to \\nmolecules called CD1a on the surface of skin immune cells and then \\nactivate T cells.   The chemicals include Balsam of  Peru  and farnesol, which are found in many personal care products, such as skin creams, toothpaste, and fragrances.    CD1a molecules bind the skin's own naturally occurring lipids in its tunnel-like interior. Those lipids protrude  from  the tunnel, creating a physical barrier that prevents CD1a  from  interacting with T cells, according to the study.   Farnesol,\\n however, was shown to hide inside the tunnel of CD1a, displacing the \\nresident natural lipids, making the CD1a surface visible to the T cells \\nand resulting in an immune reaction.   The discovery offers a new \\nidea for treatment as the allergic condition might be stopped by \\napplying competing lipids to the skin to displace those triggering the \\nimmune reaction.  \", \" The key was to rework the particle bonds in sulfur cathodes to help\\n them handle higher loads without decreases in capacity, performance or \\nstability. The technique was derived from the bridging architectures you\\n see in processing detergent powders, the university said.   The challenge is to get the battery to production. Many researchers have touted  battery breakthroughs \\n that never seem to reach shipping products. There's a lot of work \\ninvolved in bringing batteries to market, whether it's refining the \\ndesign or finding a way to produce it in large volumes, and many of \\nthese inventions either don't escape the lab or are stuck there for \\nyears.   The Monash team may be closer than most to offering a \\npractical product, mind you. Germany's Fraunhofer Institute has already \\nproduced test batteries, and scientists plan to test the design in cars \\nand solar power grids in Australia later in 2020. They've also received a\\n patent for the invention. It could still take a long time before the \\ntech reaches the real world. If and when it does, though, it could not \\nonly reduce battery hassles for mobile devices, but make it  easier to justify EVs  for those wary of range limits and long-term environmental costs.  \", '    PUBLISHED:    11:19, Mon, Jan 6, 2020        | UPDATED:  11:30, Mon, Jan 6, 2020      Thousands\\n of homes have been destroyed, tens of people have lost their lives and \\nhalf a billion animals have died as a result of wildfires across \\nAustralia.

However,\\n the commercialisation of lithium-sulphur has had many obstacles, \\nincluding a short cycle life, low cycling efficiency and poor safety.   The\\n main challenges of lithium-sulphur batteries is the low conductivity of\\n sulphur and its massive volume change during charging.   This volume change a as much as 78 per cent a can lead to a progressive loss of cohesion of sulphur particles.   This\\n can mean it reaches lower charging capacities of lithium-ion batteries \\nbefore the electrode just falls apart and the lithium-sulphur battery \\nstops working.   Sulphur is, however, very cheap and abundant and has a relatively low atomic weight and a high energy density.   Lithium-sulphur\\n batteries could potentially displace lithium-ion batteries by \\ndelivering higher specific energy a or the energy per unit mass.

They\\n can provide an energy intensity five times higher than that of \\nlithium-ion batteries, which are commonly used for portable electronics \\nand electric vehicles.   Sulphur is cheap, abundant and often the by-product of many industrial processes such as the processing of natural gas.   But the potential of the material in batteries is yet to be fully realised.   The\\n problem of lithium-sulphur batteries is that the capacity of the \\nsulphur electrode a the bit of metal in the battery that carries the \\nelectrical current a is so large that it breaks apart over multiple \\ncharging and discharging cycles.   Sulphur is cheap and abundant due to being a by-product of many industrial processes including\\xa0   Lithium-sulphur\\n batteries, once scaled up in size, could enable an electric vehicle to \\ndrive more than 620 miles without needing to 'refuel' with more \\nelectricty\\xa0   This is due to a change in volume that \\noccurs in a lithium-sulphur electrodes is around 78 per cent a about \\neight times higher than that of electrodes in lithium ion batteries, \\ncausing a loss of cohesion of particles and therefore loss of power \\ncapacity.

About seven million hectares of land has already burnt across Australia, with lives lost and homes destroyed.   The\\n time needed for vegetation to recover is unknown and will also depend \\non the severity of the fires in different areas, CSIRO principal \\nresearch scientist Andrew Sullivan says.   \"Within 12 months you \\nwill find most areas covered in a green sheen, in new spouts and \\ncoverage,\" Dr Sullivan told AAP on Monday.   \"If you continue to go\\n into drought, the response of the trees is going to be affected. If you\\n get some good rain ... the response from the native vegetation is that \\nmuch better.\"   Vegetation at the front of bushfires is likely to \\nbe burnt through, while vegetation burnt by a fire\\'s flank should bounce\\n back fairly quickly, he said.   Trees may be killed if the flames \\nscorch the crown - the top of the tree - but new shoots may grow at \\ntheir base almost immediately. Partly-burnt trees may start to regrow \\nabout midway up the trunk.   Monash University senior lecturer \\nChristoph Rudiger, whose research involves using satellites to model the\\n spread of bushfires, agrees the time frame for recovery is still \\nunknown.   \"You should see some sprouting in a few months if it is \\nthe usual (type of fire).

Instead \\nthey say Australia, which contributes 1.3% of the worldas carbon \\nemissions but is the second-largest emitter per capita behind the United\\n States, should be rewarded for beating its emissions reduction targets \\nfor 2020.    aWhen it comes to reducing global emissions, Australia \\nmust and is doing its bit, but bushfires are a time when communities \\nmust unite, not divide,a Taylor said in emailed comments to Reuters on \\nTuesday, while he was busy at bushfire relief centers in his \\nconstituency in New South Wales state.    Stepping up efforts to cut\\n emissions would harm the economy, the government argues, especially if \\nit hurt Australiaas exports of coal and gas. The country last year \\novertook Qatar as the worldas top exporter of liquefied natural gas.    aIn\\n most countries it isnat Aacceptable to pursue emissionAreduction \\npolicies that add substantially to the cost of living, Adestroy jobs, \\nreduce incomes and impede growth,a Taylor wrote in The Australian \\nnewspaper on Dec. 31.    aThatas why we wonat adopt (opposition) \\nLaboras uncosted, reckless, economy-destroying targets that will always \\nresult in a tax on Aenergy, whether it is called that or not.a    Taylor did not detail exactly how cutting emissions would raise the cost of living.     Australians\\n have complained that due to a lack of energy policy, power prices have \\nrisen substantially in recent years placing a heavy burden on household \\nincomes, even as energy producers are gradually shifting to cheaper \\nrenewables.    Tayloras came in response to criticism Australia \\nfaced at the United Nations climate summit in Madrid for blocking \\nambitious action to cut carbon emissions.    Environmental groups \\nsay Australia will only meet its emissions targets by including old \\ncarbon credits the government wants to count from the 1992 Kyoto \\nProtocol.    Scientists say climate change is a key factor in the destructive wildfires.    aOne\\n of the key drivers of fire intensity, fire spread rates and fire area \\nis temperature. And in Australia weave just experienced record high \\ntemperatures,a said Mark Howden, director of the Climate Change \\nInstitute at Australian National University.    The burning forests \\nare a double whammy for the environment, as they add to carbon emissions\\n while also removing carbon sinks which will take decades to grow back, \\nsaid David Holmes, director of the Monash University Climate Change \\nCommunication Research Hub.    Australiaas bushfires since September\\n have emitted about 350 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equal to \\ntwo-thirds the countryas annual emissions from man-made sources, \\nestimated Pep Canadell, director of the Global Carbon Project, based on \\ndata from NASA satellites.    To others, from opposition Labor to \\nfilm star Russell Crowe, who skipped the Golden Globes awards to fight \\nbushfires in Australia, to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, the link is \\nclear  between climate change and Australiaas fires which have killed 25\\n people, destroyed thousands of homes and razed more than 8 million \\nhectares (20 million acres) of land since September.

AAP Image/David Mariuz/via \\nREUTERS        aI say to those who \\nare delaying action on climate change: look at the blood-red sky and \\nunbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires,a Sanders \\nsaid on social media last week.     Amid an outbreak of fires in \\nseveral states in November, Labor leader Anthony Albanese urged Morrison\\n to beef up resources to prepare for, fight and prevent disasters.    aThe\\n fire season is starting earlier and finishing later, and emergency \\nleaders agree that extreme weather events in Australia will only \\nincrease in severity and frequency, due to climate change,a Albanese \\nwrote in the Nov. 22 letter, which he posted on social media.    Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Michael Perry  ', ' Unprecedented bushfires continue to ravage south-east Australia, with  at least 24 people confirmed dead  so far and almost 2,000 homes destroyed.    Tens of thousands of people have been  evacuated from their homes  in New South Wales and Victoria, in some cases only with  help from the Australian navy .    Serious fires have also burned in South Australia, where three people\\n have died, Western Australia and Queensland. By the end of the first \\nweek of January,  more than    8.4m hectares (20.8m acres) had been burned  across the whole country a an area bigger than the size of Scotland.   Satellite data from Nasa showed a stark increase in the number of \\nfire detections in November and December compared with previous years. \\nSatellites detect fire ahotspotsa by measuring the infrared radiation \\nemitted by the blazes.   In previous years, between 2,000 and 3,000 such hotspots were \\nrecorded each December in the south-east, while in 2019 the number \\nreached 227,000.    The fires have had catastrophic effects on the local wildlife,  killing millions of animals and threatening the survival of entire species .   Smoke plumes posed a significant health threat even to those living miles away, as the wind carried heavily polluted air to  Sydney  and  Canberra , and  as far as New Zealand .   Wildfire smoke contains poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide and \\nfine particles known as PM2.5 which pass through the lungs and can harm  virtually every organ in the human body .   A monitoring site in the Monash suburb of Canberra measured an air \\nquality index of 5,185 on Friday, more than 20 times the level that is \\nconsidered hazardous.   The devastation from the bushfires has been fuelled by the global \\nclimate crisis. Last year was Australiaas warmest on record and followed\\n a clear long-term trend. It was also the driest year on record.   The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  concluded more than a decade ago  that human-caused global heating was avirtually certaina to increase the intensity and frequency of fires in Australia.   aAs a climate scientist, the thing that really terrifies me is that \\nweather conditions considered extreme by todayas standards will seem \\nsedate in the future,a  wrote Dr JoA&lt; .     aWhatas unfolding right now is really just a taste of the new normal.a  ', ' We, the undersigned, deplore  the threat   by the US   president ,\\n made via Twitter on 4 January (and reiterated to reporters on 5 \\nJanuary), that his forces have atargeted 52 Iranian sitesa some of which\\n are aimportant to Iran &amp; the Iranian culturea. Whatever the policy \\nimplications of these words, we respond with horror to direct threats \\nagainst the people of Iran and against their tangible and intangible \\ncultural heritage.   As some have already noted, the presidentas \\ninflammatory statement is contrary to the stated aims of the 1954 Hague \\nconvention and the protocols of the Geneva conventions of 1949 and 1977.\\n Furthermore, the international criminal court considers the destruction\\n of cultural heritage to be a war crime.   We stand in solidarity \\nwith the people of Iran and state our support, at this time of great \\nanxiety, for our friends and colleagues in Iranas museums, universities \\nand heritage organisations. Their mission is of fundamental national and\\n international importance a they work to create, safeguard and interpret\\n an invaluable material legacy for present and future generations.   As\\n academic researchers of Iranian history, archaeology, art and culture, \\nbased in national museums and universities across the world, we call on \\nour political representatives to condemn explicitly any statement or \\naction that threatens internationally recognised war crimes against the \\nIranian people, as well as their cultural heritage.

Original\\n reports suggested that 500 million animals had already perished in the \\nblazes, and WWF-Australia now estimates that number is higher than one \\nbillion.   \"Australia is a land of bushfires, but this season\\'s \\nunprecedented mega fires are not normal. Climate change does not cause \\nbushfires, but it does make them much worse,\" WWF-Australia CEO Dermot \\nO\\'Gorman said in a statement.   \"This heart-breaking loss includes \\nthousands of precious koalas on the mid-north coast of NSW, along with \\nother iconic species such as kangaroos, wallabies, gliders, potoroos, \\ncockatoos and honeyeaters.\"   The loss of wildlife comes hand in \\nhand with the damage of national forests and millions of trees, \\nreleasing enormous volumes of carbon dioxide that are already affecting \\nair quality.   The Australian Medical Association has warned of new\\n health threats for people affected by the bushfires, claiming that \\nquality of health is compromised for thousands of people.   \"The \\nlength and density of smoke exposure is a new and possibly fatal health \\nrisk that many people within our community have not previously had to \\nface,\" AMA President Dr Tony Bartone said.   \"With denser smoke \\nhaze and longer periods that people endure smoke inhalation, there is a \\nmuch higher risk that previously healthy people will face developing \\nserious illness.\"   Fighting the fires also affects family and gender dynamics, according to Monash University Dr Debra Parkinson.   \"Gendered\\n expectations complicate fire plans with men frequently expected to \\ndefend homes or properties, and women frequently delaying leaving in \\norder to persuade her husband or partner to leave with her,\" Dr \\nParkinson said.   This difference on what is expected from men and \\nwomen is believed to add up to the already traumatic experience of \\nbattling the flames.   \"Disasters like the current bushfires place \\npressure on men to be resilient and stoic protectors, which makes them \\nreluctant to seek help,\" Dr Parkinson said.   \"For women in \\nbushfire-affected areas, there\\'s an expectation that they will put their\\n own needs last to support their husbands, partners and families who may\\n be traumatised from fighting fires and protecting their homes.   Mental\\n health awareness organisation Beyond Blue highlights that traumatic \\nreactions in communities an individuals affected by a bushfire are at \\ntheir worst in the first week after the event, but signals these effects\\n might last longer than a month.   \"Often, signs of trauma and distress can take months and years to emerge,\" Beyond Blue CEO Georgie Harman said.   \"But\\n it\\'s never too early to get informed about the difference between a \\nnormal and common reaction to disaster, and symptoms that indicate a \\nneed for additional professional support.\"     Advertisement    ', '     Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a writer in The New York Times Opinion section.

Having burned through  an area larger than Switzerland  and  bloodied the sky  as far as New Zealand, the fires have killed at least  25 people  and  hundreds of millions of animals , by some estimates. Hereas how people are making sense of the devastation, whoas to blame and how to help.    Like\\n California, Australia is naturally primed to burn. But global warming \\nhas worsened the problem by turning greenery into kindling. (Average \\nhighs in Australia hit a record  107.4 degrees Fahrenheit  in December, the start of the Southern Hemisphereas summer, following the driest spring on record.)    This\\n year, in what has become athe iconic representation of climate change \\nimpacts,a undeniable trends and unpredictable weather created aa \\nhorrific convergence of events,a  according to Chris Field, the director of Stanfordas environmental institute .   As the Times columnist  Paul Krugman has explained ,\\n itas not really possible to say whether global warming acauseda a given\\n extreme weather event, since weather can have several causes. But  the influence of climate change on extreme weather  in general, from fires to floods, is clear, and  increasingly so.     aThe question that we need to ask is, aHow much worse are we willing to let this get?aa  said\\n an Australian National University climate scientist, Nerilie Abram. If \\nthis is what global warming of just over 1 degree Celsius looks like, \\nMs. Abram says, do we really want to see the impacts of 3 degrees or \\nmore? Because that, she adds, ais the trajectory we are on.a   One \\nof the many heads of state leading the world down that trajectory is \\nAustraliaas prime minister, Scott Morrison. A member of the right-wing \\nLiberal Party,  he has proved hostile  to calls for more robust climate action and pledged to  outlaw forms  of environmental protest.    Australia was  ranked last out of 57 countries  on climate change policy by the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index   (just behind the United States), which singled out Mr. Morrison as a aregressive force.a     Mr. Morrison has also drawn ire  for his handling of this fire season; at one point he left for a vacation in Hawaii.    But in some ways, Mr. Morrison has simply picked up where previous Australian leaders left off,   writes the Australian novelist Richard Flanagan  in The Times: Since 1996, successive conservative governments have  subverted international agreements on climate change .   aIncredibly,a\\n Mr. Flanagan writes, athe response of Australiaas leaders to this \\nunprecedented national crisis has been not to defend their country but \\nto defend the fossil fuel industry, a big donor to both major parties.a    aMorrison is right about one thing a the only solution is global action,a   writes Ross Gittins ,\\n the economics editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, Australiaas oldest \\nnewspaper. While Mr. Morrison certainly deserves blame, Mr. Gittins \\nsays, nothing Australia could have done by itself would have prevented \\nthe current devastation, since the country accounts  for only 1.3 percent of global emissions .   aAll\\n the big, rich economies a particularly the Americans, less so the \\nEuropeans a must share the blame for the continuing rise in average \\ntemperatures,a he writes.   aEven the biggest developing economies a China and India, particularly a could have done more to reduce the  intensity  of their emissions (emissions per dollar of G.D.P.) without abandoning their efforts to raise their living standards.a    aIf\\n in the past year (or the past decade) the world began to understand how\\n dangerous climate change is, it certainly didnat act like it,a  Elizabeth Kolbert, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of aThe Sixth Extinction,a  writes in The New Yorker .\\n In the past 10 years, she says, more carbon dioxide was emitted than in\\n all of human history up to the election of John F. Kennedy.   aReally\\n waking up, and not just dreaming to ourselves that things will be O.K.,\\n has become urgent a beyond urgent,a she writes. She paraphrases fire \\nofficials in the Australian state of Victoria: aThe world is in danger, \\nand we need to act immediately to survive.a     [Related: aThis apocalyptic Australian summer is our Sandy Hook moment.a]      Cutting carbon emissions is no longer enough ,\\n according to David Bowman, a professor of fire science at the \\nUniversity of Tasmania. aWe still have to decarbonize but now we also \\nhave to adapt,a  he writes in The Conversation .   One\\n adaptation Australians could make, he suggests, is shifting the \\ntraditional vacation season a during which schools have their summer \\nbreak a to cooler months, so that families arenat heading into the \\ncountryas forests and national parks at the peak of fire season.    Rearranging\\n the calendar around risk may meet resistance, he writes, but it could \\nreduce the strain on firefighters and make mass evacuations easier.    California could learn something from Australiaas fire warning system ,  writes Diana Leonard \\n in The Washington Post. After the disastrous Black Saturday fires of \\n2009, which killed 173 people, the country developed a more \\nsophisticated, national warning protocol, which the chief executive of \\nthe Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Center in \\nMelbourne believes has saved lives.    The National Weather Service \\nprovides something of a similar function for tornadoes and severe \\nthunderstorms in the United States, but in California fire evacuation \\norders are issued by local law enforcement, a system that hasnat always \\nkept pace with the most extreme blazes. aA more centralized system, like\\n the one in Australia, could allow the public to access information \\nabout the location and spread of a dangerous fire in real time,a Ms. \\nLeonard writes.    Australia has an arson problem ,  writes Paul Read \\n in The Australian Financial Review. A senior lecturer at the School of \\nPsychological Sciences at Monash University, Mr. Read notes that  as much as 50 percent \\n of Australiaas wildfires are potentially set deliberately. The New \\nSouth Wales Police Force announced on Monday that it had charged  24 people in connection with bush fire arson .   aIf\\n we are to prevent bush fires and save lives, property and wildlife, we \\nwill also need to find solutions for the other more complex human \\ndimensions of the causes of conflagrations like the ones we are now \\nwitnessing,\" he writes.   More than a million people have donated upward of $20 million to  a Facebook fund-raising page  started by the Australian comedian Celeste Barber,  the largest ever  such effort on the platform. The money will reportedly be distributed to the  countryas firefighting services . Another Facebook fund-raising page has raised more than $4 million for  WIRES , Australiaas largest wildlife rescue organization.     aNot all heroes wear capes.a \\n An Instagram model named Kaylen Ward (alias the Naked Philanthropist) \\nsays she has raised $500,000 by direct messaging her nude photos to \\nfollowers in exchange for proof of a charitable donation,  reports Kim Bellware  in The Washington Post.

The Bureau of\\n Meteorology's (BOM) long-range climate outlook predicted above average \\ntemperatures and below average rainfall for much of the east through \\nuntil at least the end of March.   Weatherzone meteorologist Tom Hough said: 'Warmer than average and drier than average is the trend that looks to be continuing.   'Based off the climate outlooks it doesn't look like we're going to see any significant rainfall.'   In\\n a piece for The Conversation, Monash University emeritus professor \\nNeville Nicholls said Australia has already suffered through severe \\nheatwaves this summer, but it may get worse.   'They usually peak in the middle and end of summer, so the worst may be yet to come.'   Billions of animals are believed to have perished in the blazes and experts fear some may now be extinct.

The\\n Australian Medical Association has warned of new health threats for \\npeople affected by the bushfires, claiming that quality of health is \\ncompromised for thousands of people.

'Gendered\\n expectations complicate fire plans with men frequently expected to \\ndefend homes or properties, and women frequently delaying leaving in \\norder to persuade her husband or partner to leave with her,' Dr \\nParkinson said.   This difference on what is expected from men and \\nwomen is believed to add up to the already traumatic experience of \\nbattling the flames.   'Disasters like the current bushfires place \\npressure on men to be resilient and stoic protectors, which makes them \\nreluctant to seek help,' Dr Parkinson said.   'For women in \\nbushfire-affected areas, there's an expectation that they will put their\\n own needs last to support their husbands, partners and families who may\\n be traumatised from fighting fires and protecting their homes.

For more than five months, fires have been cutting deadly paths \\nacross much of the continent. Their sheer size and intensity have been \\non a scale not previously seen in the country.   So far, fires have burned through more than 6 million hectares of \\nland, and about 2,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed. Remote \\nvillages have been obliterated and millions of farm animals have died, \\nand an estimated half a billion wild animals have been killed and their \\nhabitats destroyed.   At least 25 people have died, with many more injured, and the \\nemotional and mental toll on those who have survived is immeasurable.   By Monday, the extreme weather conditions had eased, with cooler \\ntemperatures and rainfall bringing relief to exhausted firefighters in \\nsome areas. But by Tuesday morning, more than 130 blazes were reported \\nacross the country.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison is considering calling a Royal \\nCommission to look into the fires and the government\\'s response, as \\ncriticism mounts over his handling of the emergency.   Morrison\\'s response to the fires has been criticized as slow, \\nalthough days ago he made history by mobilizing 3,000 reserve troops. \\nHowever, the decision to release a government video, with a musical \\nsoundtrack, announcing the government\\'s mobilization of military assets \\nwas seen by many as tacky.   In addition, the federal government announced on Sunday the setting \\nup of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, with more than A$2 billion \\n($1.38 billion) for rebuilding infrastructure.   Politician Richard Di Natale, leader of the Australian Greens \\npolitical party, has described the fires as Australia\\'s \"moment of \\ntruth\".   \"We must accept that Australia\\'s climate has changed, and we need to \\nmake sure that our land management, disaster response and climate \\npolicies are relevant to the new reality we face,\" he said in a \\nstatement.   The impact of the fires is being felt well beyond Australia\\'s \\nborders. In New Zealand, around 1,600 kilometers across the Tasman Sea, \\nsmoke from the fires has turned pristine glaciers brown.   David Holmes, director of the Monash Climate Change Communication \\nResearch Hub at Melbourne\\'s Monash University, said, \"This isn\\'t just \\nabout cyclical drought, which politicians like to use to normalize the \\ncurrent situation.   \"In the last 15 years, Australia saw eight of its 10 warmest years on\\n record. Climate scientists tell us that, with climate change, weather \\nsystems increasingly move poleward. This means that storm tracks that \\nonce brought moisture from the Southern Ocean right up the east coast \\nare not reaching as far, and inland forested areas are becoming much \\ndrier,\" he said.   David Bowman, a professor of pyrogeography and fire science at the \\nUniversity of Tasmania, said the bushfires provide a \"critical link to \\nunderstanding how climate change will transform bushfire behavior, \\nfrequency and ecological impacts\".   \"We are now transiting away from what climate models tell us about \\nthe possible effects of climate change on bushfires, to observing and \\nexperiencing extreme, unusual and ecologically and economically damaging\\n bushfires driven by anomalous climate conditions,\" he said.   This is all new ground, said Bowman. However, he added, \"As a \\nsociety, we are running out of time to adapt to climate changedriven \\nbushfires, and policy failure will lead to escalating disasters that \\nhave the capacity to eclipse the worst disasters we have experienced.\"   The Climate Council, in a paper on bushfires and climate, said that \\nfor more than 20 years scientists have warned that climate change would \\nincrease the risk of extreme bushfires in Australia.   \"This warning was accurate. Scientists expect extreme fire weather \\nwill continue to become more frequent and severe without substantial and\\n rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" the council paper \\nsaid.   In 2009, Australia\\'s Common-wealth Scientific and Industrial Research\\n Organisation warned of the coming dangers of extreme weather conditions\\n and their impact on bushfires. In a paper titled \"Climate Change\\', the \\nagency said, \"For Australia, heatwaves, fires, floods and southern \\nAustralian droughts are all expected to become more frequent and more \\nintense in the coming decades.   \"Snow and frost are very likely to become rarer or less intense \\nevents. Locally and regionally, the greatest impacts will be felt \\nthrough changes in water availability and sea level, and extreme weather\\n events,\" the report said.   In March last year, former state fire commissioners warned Prime \\nMinister Morrison that the extreme weather conditionsi 1/4 long, hot dry \\nperiods with little or no rain, and dry winds and prolonged droughti 1/4 will\\n bring devastating bushfires on a scale never before seen in the \\ncountry.   Jim McLennan, a bushfire safety researcher and adjunct professor with\\n the school of Psychology and Public Health at Melbourne\\'s La Trobe \\nUniversity, said climate change is a factor that cannot be ignored, \\ngiven the fires that have swept along Australia\\'s east coast.   \"Average temperatures across the country have risen and our summers are getting hotter,\" he said.   \"During the last two years, annual rainfalls have been well below \\nlong-term averages. In addition, annual rainfall patterns have changed, \\nso that there are longer periods between rain events. This has resulted \\nin drought conditions in many parts of Australia.\"   The result is that soil moisture levels are low and vegetation is \\ndryer, McLennan said. Bushfires are becoming more frequent, and the fire\\n season is lasting longer.   The long-term changes in Australia\\'s climate, identified by climate \\nscientists as resulting from global warming, mean that \"the intense \\nfires we are witnessing will become more frequent, and they are now \\noccurring in areas which were previously very low bushfire risk areas,\" \\nhe said.  ', '  Expert says rise in temperature and reduced rainfall across country led to severe weather    Australia has just lived through its warmest and driest year on \\nrecord, according to the Bureau of Meteorology\\'s Annual Climate \\nStatement.   The average mean temperature in 2019 was 1.52 C above average, said \\nthe bureau\\'s head of climate monitoring, Karl Braganza, at a media \\nbriefing on Jan 8.   The national average rainfall for the year was 277 millimeters, the lowest on record.   Braganza said that while the debate on climate change continues, \\nthere is little doubt climate change has \"played a big part\" in the \\ndisastrous fire season, adding, \"the science is quite clear on that\".   \"We are now seeing clear, well-defined trends in climate change over the past several decades in Australia,\" he said.   \"We are seeing trends in maximum temperature rises, reduced rainfall \\nthroughout the country, especially in southwest Western Australia and in\\n the southeast of the country (New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania).\"   Braganza said the mix has contributed to the severe fire weather now being experienced across Australia.   Since the fires began in September in southern Queensland, some six \\nmillion hectares of land has been burned around the country. In the \\nstate of New South Wales alone, the loss has been four million hectares.   The death toll from the current bushfire season was 26 people by Jan \\n8, compared with 173 in Victoria state\\'s Black Saturday fires of 2009. \\nAnalysts attributed the reduced mortality to the courage of communities \\nand firefighters, with the assistance of other states and nations, the \\nmilitary, new technologies, and in some cases the policies put in place \\nas a result of the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission.   Paul Read, a senior research fellow at the Monash Sustainability \\nInstitute at Monash University and a co-director of the National Centre \\nfor Research in Bushfire and Arson, said: \"Despite resistance from \\npeople who become enraged at the very mention of climate or Greta \\nThunberg (the young Swedish climate activist), these fires are \\nunprecedented in Australian history and the reasons have all the \\nhallmarks of climate change.

For reprint rights:  Times Syndication Service   ', ' After 50 years of writing more than 50 plays, David Williamson insists he is retiring from the theatre.   Turning 78 this February, the Noosa, south Queensland-based \\nplaywright is about to see his last two new plays produced back to back \\nin Sydney where he built his career, while his classic \\nsemi-autobiographical satire of the harbour metropolis, Emerald City, \\nwill be remounted in a new production in Brisbane and Melbourne.   Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact he is widely regarded as \\nAustraliaas most commercially successful playwright, with a loyal \\naudience hooked on his naturalistic style of storytelling about the \\nwhite middle class, Williamsonas relationship with the people he sees as\\n the cultural gatekeepers a theatre critics a has been fraught. \\nWilliamson says critics dismiss his work because it is popular, although\\n the  quality of his work  has also been questioned. He once accused the Sydney Theatre Company  of ignoring his plays  abecause Iam not theatre with a capital Ta.   Williamson argues his playwrighting has always examined human \\npsychology and verbal self-deception. But he now says he wants to make \\nway for younger voices, including the minority playwrights he \\nacknowledges have been denied a platform, to tackle the many issues \\nAustralia is facing. Heas had a adream runa, he emphasises, and acanat \\nwhingea about his unabated box office success.   For Williamson, who has five children and 14 grandchildren, \\nretirement is also motivated by his health: he has a long-term heart \\nrhythm problem and several years ago suffered a  transient ischaemic attack ,\\n which temporarily paralysed the right side of his body. aThe whole \\nprocess is stressful, from the writing of 12 or 15 drafts to the whole \\nbusiness of opening nights,a he says. aFor many years, I couldnat even \\ngo to an opening night. I had to have Kristin [Williamson, his wife and a\\n fellow writer] reporting to me how things were going.   aYou go to a brilliant opening night, you know it has connected, and \\nthen you think [of the critics]: aOh those fuckersa. I remember one \\n[review] line that said, aI sat with a dark cloud hovering above me as \\npeople fell off their seats laughing around mea. And you think, what is \\nso terrible about that? Why did the black cloud descend upon him to see \\npeople enjoying themselves in the theatre?a   Famously, Williamsonas writing has often been clearly drawn from his \\nexperiences. In the early 1970s, he left his then-pregnant wife for his \\ncurrent wife, who also left her husband. This became the basis for his \\nearly play Jugglers Three, a depiction of two marriages breaking up, \\nrewritten many years later as Third World Blues in which a character \\ncalled Elizabeth accuses a character called Neville, based on \\nWilliamson, of having a ahyperinflated egoa.   Is everything in his life playwriting material? aWell, I have drawn \\non life. Any writer who says they donat is lying. But you do change and \\nalter [the details].a   In her 2009 biography of Williamson, Kristin a who met the playwright\\n when she was cast in one of his early plays a argued that the aoutraged\\n letters and emailsa her husband afired off in fits of ragea to critics,\\n directors and producers were borne of a sensitivity that also made him \\nan aastute dramatista who could perceive amalignant undercurrents in \\nsocial behavioura.   We meet in the rehearsal room for his  new play Family Values .\\n Williamson stands more than two metres tall; he used to fantasise about\\n being shorter so he wouldnat stand out so much. He is affable, sincere,\\n a good listener, eloquent and forthcoming in his responses, although he\\n brings up the critics of his work much earlier than I had planned: itas\\n clearly a spectre that will always bother him, even while acknowledging\\n he has overreacted on occasion.   He agrees with his wifeas take on his psychology a but adds the \\nrhythms of the abitter fightinga between his late parents, gregarious \\nretail saleswoman mother Elvie and quiet accountant father Keith, also \\naenormouslya influenced his work.   aI didnat realise it at the time, but my brother and I grew up in a \\nhouse of perpetual drama,a he says. aThere was hardly a minute when they\\n werenat having a go at each other. It wasnat until the age of 11 that I\\n realised it was a bit more complex than that, when I caught my mother \\ngoading my father to the point of an explosion.   aHe was never a physically violent man, but finally he could be \\nprovoked into calling her names. I remember when my mother raced out to \\nthe laundry, and I followed her: she was chuckling away.a A few years \\nbefore her death, Williamson brought up the memory, and asked her what \\nwas going on. aWell, it did get pretty boring in the country,a she \\nanswered.   aShe was sparking the drama,a he says now. aI spent my young life \\nwondering, aHow can I avoid this? Is this what marriage means?aa   Born in 1942, Williamson grew up in the middle-class suburb of \\nBentleigh, then on Melbourneas outskirts. The family moved when he was \\n12 to country Bairnsdale.   At the time, theatres in Australia offered virtually no plays about \\ncontemporary Australian society. In 1964, Williamson became Monash \\nUniversityas first graduate in mechanical engineering a but as an \\nassistant project engineer at General Motors-Holden he would read \\nChekhov under the desk.   Williamsonas subsequent study of psychology at Melbourne University \\nwould inspire him to think of himself as a asocial scientista, and he \\nbegan writing plays. In 1971, his middle-class suburban election night \\nsatire, Donas Party, was a hit at the Pram Factory, but the collective \\nthat ran  La Mama theatre \\n in Carlton thought it too bourgeoisie a so he wrote them a hard-hitting\\n look at police and male brutality, The Removalists, which won him a \\nprestigious award in London.   Instead of moving his career there in the wake of this international \\nattention, he sensed his continued connection to Australian place and \\nvernacular was critical to his writing. Williamson stayed home and rode \\nthe 1970s Australian anew wavea film industry resurgence, adapting many \\nof his stage plays into successfully produced screenplays.   In his youth, Kristin Williamson wrote, David abecame a zealous \\nleftwinger, to the extent that he tried to convert his parentsa. Is he \\nstill politically to the left? aOh yes,a he says now. aDespite what some\\n of my critics have said about me being a social conservative, there is \\nan underlying social concern in all but a few of my plays. I always hope\\n to be entertaining on the surface, but saying something about the state\\n of our society in the subtext.   aI havenat lost that. I am so angered by the growing injustices and \\ninequalities in the world that it does still fire me up. Itas almost \\npainful to pick up the Murdoch press every day and see the blatant \\nattack on social progressivism of any kind, the fervent belief in \\nneoliberalism, despite the world heading towards a real catastrophe.   aThe honchos tend to be ageing white males, wealthy white males, who \\nare incredibly threatened by the science of climate change, because it \\nthreatens their whole world view that neoliberalism has delivered huge \\nprosperity to the world, that growth can go on forever, that there will \\nbe no evil consequences.a   Indeed, Williamsonas final two new plays offer social critiques of \\nAustralia now. Family Values reflects the writeras disdain for \\nAustraliaas refugee policy, and has an asylum seeker character. \\nMandatory offshore detention ahas been one of the morally despicable \\nacts the Australian government has carried out, and both sides are \\nguilty a Labor started ita, he says. aI fail to understand  Jacqui Lambie voting against medevac  because she said openly medevac is no threat to Australian security.a   The other play,  Crunch Time \\n a a blackly comic story of a father and son healing a relationship a \\ncarries the theme of assisted death. Williamson laments the failure of \\nmost states to adopt voluntary euthanasia laws. aThe NSW Liberal party \\nseems to be still in thrall of the religious right, and itas the lizard \\nbrain dictating the rational capacity of human beings; itas some \\nemotional fear that someone is going to turn the switch off on them, or \\nGod wants to prolong our pain as long as possible before we have a \\ndecent death,a he says.   Would Williamson want voluntary euthanasia for himself, if it came to\\n that? aAbsolutely. I saw a friend die recently of pancreatic cancer, \\nand they fade away to a human skeleton. Itas a horrible way to leave an \\nimage for your loved ones.   aIad rather go out when they still recognise me as me, so thereas a \\nbit of vanity, but also Iad want to avoid the extreme pain of the end \\ngame.a     aC/  Family Values runs at  SBW Stables  at Griffin Theatre in Sydney from 17 January until 7 March. Crunch Time runs at  Ensemble Theatre  in Sydney from 14 February until 9 April. Emerald City runs in Brisbane at  QPAC Playhouse  from 8-29 February, and in Melbourne at  Southbank Theatre, The Sumner  from 6 March to 18 April.   ', '  This article originally appeared on  VICE Australia  .   There\\n are parts of Australia where itas currently a health risk to step \\noutside and breathe. One is the nationas capital, which last week \\nboasted  the most heavily polluted air in the world .\\n At 1 a.m. on New Yearas Day, an air monitoring site in Canberra \\nrecorded levels of pollution more than 25 times higher than what\\'s \\nconsidered ahazardous.a   Two weeks earlier, the Climate and Health Alliance (CAHA) issued  a joint statement \\n declaring that the poor air quality throughout the state of New South \\nWales constituted a public health emergency. aThere is no safe level of \\nair pollution,a the statement cautioned. aThe higher the level of \\npollution, the more hazardous the risks to health. Bushfire smoke is \\nparticularly hazardous because of the high levels of tiny particles.a   Now,\\n as hundreds of thousands of acres burn throughout the country, people \\naround Australia are passively inhaling some of the least breathable air\\n on the planet; it\\'s more heavily polluted than that of Shanghai, \\nBeijing, Mumbai, or Delhi. Clouds of smoke are traveling hundreds of \\nmiles, enveloping the nationas major cities and drifting as far as New \\nZealand. The public health emergency continues to escalate. And \\naccording to Dr. Yuming Guo, head of Monash Universityas Climate and Air\\n Quality Research (CARE) unit, such toxic air could easily become the \\nsilent killer of Australiaas climate catastrophe.   Image by Wendell Teodoro (ZEDUCE/AFP)   aAny amount of pollution is badabut the air quality in Australia at the moment is   really \\n bad,a he told VICE over the phone. aIn the short-term, this kind of \\npollution could increase the risk of death, hospital admissions, \\nemergency department visits, and ambulance calls. In the long-term it \\nmight be associated with shortened life expectancy and the development \\nof diseasesarespiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, \\ndementiaaas well as mental health problems, and adverse birth outcomes.a   When\\n Dr. Guo says ashort-terma he means the days and weeks during which the \\npollution is directly experienced; when he says along-terma heas talking\\n about months or years down the line. Pollutants can kill people fast \\nand slow. And further exacerbating these health risks is the fact that \\nAustralia has, until now, enjoyed a history of clean air.    Dr. \\nGuo explained that while usually the aair quality here is very good,a \\nthis ultimately means the Australian people are more vulnerable to air \\npollution because they havenat physically adapted to be able to cope \\nwith it. aTheyare more likely to see those health impacts,a as he puts \\nit. aAnd the air in Australia got very bad very fastaso thatas also a \\nproblem.a   Children and the elderly face a particularly serious \\nrisk because their bodies are even less well-adapted, while people with \\nasthma are far more susceptible to suffering the adverse respiratory \\neffects of smoke inhalation. Experts have warned, however, that even \\nrelatively healthy people are at risk of developing serious illnesses \\nfrom prolonged exposure to air pollution.    Tony Bartone, \\npresident of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), described the \\nlength and density of smoke exposure in Australia at the moment as aa \\nnew and possibly fatal health risk that many people within our community\\n have not previously had to face.a   \"With denser smoke haze and \\nlonger periods that people endure smoke inhalation, there is a much \\nhigher risk that previously healthy people will face developing serious \\nillness,\" he said in a  statement , and went on to note that athe mental health burden of this disaster on our communities will be considerable.a   Recent\\n studies have drawn similar connections between air pollution and mental\\n health outcomes, with at least one research paper  linking poor air quality to an increased risk of depression and suicide .\\n In that study, a team of researchers from University College London \\n(UCL) and Kingas College London found that long-term exposure to fine \\nparticulate matterathat is, tiny particles of dust and sootawas linked \\nto depression and anxiety. They also found that short-term exposure to \\ncoarse particulate matterasuch as those found in dust and smokeaappears \\nto influence the risk of suicide.   \"Our findings correspond with \\nother studies that have come out this year, with further evidence in \\nyoung people and in other mental health conditions,a said senior author \\nDr. Joseph Hayes in a  statement .\\n aWhile we cannot yet say that this relationship is causal, the evidence\\n is highly suggestive that air pollution itself increases the risk of \\nadverse mental health outcomes.\"   Dr. Guo echoed these warnings, \\npointing to a study that looked at the health impacts of the 2014 \\nHazelwood fireaa blaze in a Victorian coal mine that burned for weeks, \\nblanketing surrounding communities in smoke. Findings suggested that \\napeople exposed to smoke during the 2014 Hazelwood mine fire were still \\nexperiencing psychological distress and respiratory symptoms two and a \\nhalf years later.a Dr. Guo stressed, however, that aeveryone in the \\ncountry should be prepared [for the current bushfire season].a   There\\n are those who are already taking precautionary measures by wearing face\\n masks and staying indoors. Dr. Guo endorsed these methods of harm \\nreduction, but insisted that the masks need to be high qualityaan N95 or\\n P2 arespiratora mask that filters out at least 95 percent of tiny \\nparticlesaand people need to check their houses for air leaks. He \\nfurther advised that people use high quality air conditioners with \\nfilters or standalone air purifiers if possible, and avoid exercising \\neither indoors or outdoors. Those who start seeing adverse health \\neffects should seek out the relevant medicine. Above all else, though, \\nDr. Guo advises staying out of the polluted air whenever possible.   aPeople\\n shouldnat go outside at all in places like Canberra or the badly \\naffected communities, but if necessary they should only go outside for a\\n short distanceato buy food, for example,a he said. aThere are fires in \\nall parts of the country, so air pollution is everywhere. Itas going to \\nbe a real problem.a     Follow Gavin Butler on    Twitter    or    Instagram .   ', '   S  moke from this seasonas bushfires has \\nturned the sun red, the moon orange and the sky an insipid grey. It has \\nobscured iconic views tourists flock to see. Far more than an aesthetic \\nproblem, it has forced business shutdowns, triggered health problems and\\n kept children indoors for weeks.   City dwellers in south-east Australia have been forced to take a \\ncrash course in the finer points of air pollution. Weave learned about \\nthe dangers of inhaling tiny PM2.5 particles (those 2.5 microns or fewer\\n in diameter). Weave learned that only a  close-fitting P2 mask  will do much to protect us.   Still, we wear disposable paper masks and hold handkerchiefs to our faces, hoping any amount of filtering is helpful.   Even for an historian of air pollution like me, this situation is a \\nshock. It is not the first time Australiaas major cities have been \\nshrouded in bushfire smoke. But the terrible air quality is unmatched in\\n terms of severity, duration and extent.   Historically, air pollution from smoke was considered outside human \\ncontrol and not subject to regulation. But these bushfires are  clearly linked to global warming , for which government, corporations and individuals are responsible. Itas time to rethink the way we protect air quality.   In recent weeks, apps such as  AirVisual \\n have confirmed what we city dwellers can already see and smell: since \\nthe fires on the north coast of New South Wales began in late October, \\nour air quality has plummeted.   The NSW governmentas  Air Quality Index \\n data has shown that since late October, days when the index was higher \\nthan 100 a signalling exposure is unhealthy a have outnumbered clear \\ndays in Sydney, Newcastle and the Illawarra.   Index readings above 2,550 have been recorded in Sydney, while the  Monash monitoring site  in Canberra reached a choking 5,185 at 8pm on New Yearas Day.   Bushfire smoke has affected the cities of NSW and the Australian Capital Territory in the past.  In late January 1926 ,\\n when Canberra was just emerging as a city, a thick haze of smoke sat \\nover the site. Fires came within metres of Yarralumla, the residence \\nwhich, the following year, would become home to the governor general.   In several years in the mid-1930s, bushfires burning to the north of Sydney left the city air thick with smoke.  In October 1936 , bushfire smoke forced a motor liner arriving from Hong Kong to  warily enter the harbour  sounding its siren, because it was invisible to signallers on South Head.   A New Zealand pilot, flying into Sydney from Longreach the following month, had to  fly blind \\n in agreat clouds of dense smokea covering much of NSW. In 1939, \\nCanberra was covered by what the visiting writer HG Wells described as a\\n  astreaming smoke curtaina .   In the summer of 1944, Sydney was again enveloped in a smoke haze, \\nthis time from fires in the Blue Mountains and (later Royal) national \\npark in November. Photographs published at the time show the  Sydney Harbour Bridge \\n barely visible through dust and smoke at midday. The ongoing fires were\\n blamed for an increase in diseases of the ears, nose and throat, and \\nfor cases of influenza and pneumonia, leading to a shortage of hospital \\nbeds.   In November 1951, all of NSW was said to be blacked out by bushfire smoke. In Sydney on the worst days, records show  all four of the cityas airfields  were closed because of asmoke-foga.   In each of these episodes, bushfire smoke disrupted transport, \\ncommerce, health and the enjoyment of the urban environment. But even as\\n other forms of air pollution began to be regulated, smoke from \\nbushfires escaped legislative attention.   What was understood as air pollution were the unwanted byproducts of \\nindustrial processes, whereas bushfire smoke was viewed as natural.    In NSW in 1866 ,\\n an act based on British legislation restricted smoke from mills, \\ndistilleries and gas works. Further limitations on smoke production in \\nbuilt-up areas were included in later acts governing public health \\n(1902), motor traffic (1909) and local government (1919).   After the second world war  Newcastle ,\\n the site of the countryas largest concentration of coal-burning heavy \\nindustry, began to pay closer attention to managing air quality. This \\npioneering work was given added urgency after  4,000 people died  in heavy London smog in 1952.   In 1958, a NSW parliamentary committee delivered a  report \\n into smoke abatement. It did not mention recent issues with bushfire \\nsmoke, and also dismissed the impact of domestically produced smoke. The\\n subsequent  1961 Clean Air Act  focused on air pollution from industry, transport and power generation.   Air pollution legislation continued to  evolve in following decades ,\\n targeting motor vehicle emissions in the 1970s, backyard burning of \\nwaste in the 1980s, and wood fires used to heat homes in the 1990s.   These measures have been successful. A  2006 study \\n found that between 1998 and 2003, on the limited occasions when \\nstandards for PM10 in six Australian cities were exceeded, the main \\nsources were not industry or transport, but dust storms and bushfires \\n(with the exception of Launceston, where heating fires were the main \\ncontributor).   Today, bushfire smoke is excluded from air quality regulations, \\ndespite its obvious role in pollution. It is still considered natural \\nand beyond human control.   However, the  link between the current fires and human-caused climate change , long predicted by climate scientists, suggests this exemption is no longer valid.   As the Australian National Universityas  Tom Griffiths \\n has written, the current fires in some ways repeat patterns of the \\npast. But athe smoke is worse, more widespread and more enduringa.   When Australia begins the recovery from these fires, our \\nbusiness-as-usual approach requires a rethink. Measures to protect air \\nquality should be a major part of this.   It is time that corporations, governments and societies which \\ncontribute to global heating be held to account for more frequent, \\nintense and widespread bushfires, and the smoke which billows from them.

Toxic air pollution clouded Melbourne on Tuesday, halting practice sessions and slightly delaying qualifying.   AFP Sport looks at the implications for players and fans at the first\\n Major tennis tournament of the year, which starts on Monday:    - What are the dangers? -    Air pollution could pose health problems for players, fans and \\nofficials, especially in the high temperatures of the Australian \\nsummer.\\xa0   Until Tuesday, Melbourne hadn\\'t been as badly affected as Canberra or Sydney, but conditions deteriorated suddenly.   Air pollution shot up to \"hazardous\" levels, city authorities said, telling residents to stay indoors and keep pets inside.   Australian Open practice was suspended and qualifying delayed. \\nSlovenian qualifier Dalila Jakupovic had to retire from her match after \\nsuffering a coughing fit, although it wasn\\'t clear if pollution was to \\nblame.   However, Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley has said he expects the tournament to go ahead as scheduled.\\xa0   \"We don\\'t expect any delays and we\\'ve implemented additional measures\\n to ensure the Australian Open will be able to run as scheduled,\" Tiley \\nsaid last week.    - How bad can it get? -    Fires are still burning in Victoria, where Melbourne is the state \\ncapital, and could continue throughout the tournament, with huge blazes \\nto the city\\'s east.\\xa0   \"It is going to depend on the prevailing winds and whether we have \\nongoing fires,\" Christine Jenkins, professor of respiratory medicine at \\nthe University of New South Wales in Sydney, told AFP.\\xa0   \"It\\'s still an open question just whether or not we could still have further periods of intense pollution.\"\\xa0   On Tuesday, air quality monitors recorded pollution at 20 times greater than safe levels in some parts of Melbourne.   \"There is very definitely the threat of fire that could cause significant air pollution in Melbourne,\" Jenkins said.    - What are the health risks? -    Players who are recovering from respiratory tract infections are particularly at risk, as well as those with asthma.\\xa0   Pollution can irritate the respiratory tract, intensifying and \\nprolonging symptoms -- but the health dangers don\\'t stop there.\\xa0   \"It (pollution) increases the risks of respiratory symptoms, \\ncardiovascular disorder, eye symptoms, or mental disorders,\" warned \\nProfessor Yuming Guo, head of the Climate, Air Quality Research Unit at \\nthe School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at Monash University\\n in Melbourne.\\xa0   \"All these would influence of the performance of the players.\"\\xa0    - What\\'s being done for players? -    Meteorological and air quality experts will be on site to monitor \\nconditions. Any smoke hazards will be treated in a similar way to \\nextreme heat and rain, with umpires able to stop play if air monitoring \\nshows it is too dangerous to continue.\\xa0   Melbourne Park, the venue for the Australian Open, has three roofed \\nstadiums and eight other indoor courts. While facemasks are impractical \\nfor players, Jenkins advised them to stay hydrated and get plenty of \\nrest.   \"Staying well hydrated keeps the respiratory membranes well moistened and less prone to irritative symptoms,\" she said.\\xa0   \"Avoiding alcohol, getting plenty of rest, sleeping normal hours and \\nnot being outdoors any more than you need to be. Difficult for players, \\nbecause they\\'re on practice courts and they\\'re constantly trying to keep\\n their (practice) hours up.\"    - Have the fires affected other events? -    Last month\\'s SOLAS Big Boat Challenge in Sydney was cancelled after \\nthick smoke from bushfires sent visibility plunging on Sydney Harbour. A\\n Big Bash cricket match in Canberra was also scrapped because of poor \\nair quality and visibility.\\xa0   At the Australian Open golf tournament in Sydney last month, players \\ncomplained of stinging eyes. and 2015 champion Matt Jones said \\nconditions were some of the worse he had ever encountered. In November, \\nRally Australia, the last leg of the FIA World Rally Championship, was \\ncancelled.   But most sports fixtures have gone ahead. Australia played cricket \\nTest matches against New Zealand in Melbourne and Sydney. And the 10-day\\n the ATP Cup tennis tournament has proceeded in Sydney, Brisbane and \\nPerth without serious problems.\\xa0    - Could the Australian Open be cancelled? -    Unlikely. Even if air pollution remains high, organisers would be \\nreluctant to axe what is perhaps Australia\\'s biggest sports event of the\\n year, and one of only four Grand Slam tournaments on the tennis \\ncalendar.   According to The Australian newspaper, they will be well covered if \\nthey do: an insurance policy will provide a hefty pay-out stretching \\ninto nine figures in the event of a cancellation due to extreme weather.   However, at least one health expert would support delaying or axing the tournament altogether if air quality remains low.   \"If the air pollution is still serious, it would be better to postpone or cancel it,\" said Guo.   \"People when playing or exercising are more affected by air \\npollution, because they inhale deeply forcing air into their lower \\nrespiratory system where air pollutants accumulate with prolonged \\nexposure.\"    A(c) Agence France-Presse     For more sports coverage, visit the  ABS-CBN Sports website.   \\n\\xa0  ', '   I  n April 2005, a fire burnt much of \\nVictoriaas beloved national park at Wilsons Promontory leading to the \\nevacuation of holidaymakers from Tidal River. The fire was the result of\\n a fuel reduction burn, which escaped 10 days after it was lit when the \\nweather became hot and windy. I remember it well as I was Victoriaas \\nenvironment minister at the time, responsible for the park and the burn.   The then premier Steve Bracks was one of the campers evacuated.   In 2015 a fuel reduction burn at Lancefield in  Victoria \\n escaped, causing a fire that destroyed six homes and caused a great \\ndeal of anguish for the local community. There have been many such \\ninstances of fuel reduction burns escaping and causing damage in \\ndifferent parts of Australia. The risk of putting fire in the landscape \\nfor fuel reduction is real.   For years, elements of the media have promoted the idea that \\nagreeniesa and environmentalists have prevented fuel reduction burning. \\nThis particularly suits those with an agenda to deny climate change as \\nit simultaneously advances the culture war against environmentalists and\\n draws attention away from the need to take action on climate change. As\\n environment minister, I donat recall ever being influenced or lobbied \\nby environmentalists or agreensa to stop fuel reduction burns.   What does stand in the way of planned burns is climate change: higher\\n temperatures, dryer fuel and strong winds in autumn and spring making \\nit unsafe to burn. A shorter timeframe for safe burning a not adebate by\\n environmentalistsa a is the overwhelming factor.   Much attention has been given to the recommendation of the Victorian  Bushfires \\n Royal Commission to implement a program of planned burning based on an \\nannual target of 5% of public land a 390,000 hectares for Victoria. The \\nformer Victorian premier Jeff Kennett and others have criticised the \\nVictorian government for not achieving this target.   However, these criticisms not only ignore the climate-related \\ndifficulties with planned burning, they also fail to take account of the\\n expert advice received in the years since the royal commission \\nreported.   The weather-related difficulties in achieving a hectare-based target \\nwere born out in 2014, the last year of the Napthine Coalition \\ngovernment, when only 82,022 hectares were burnt despite the \\ngovernmentas commitment to the 5% target. Kennettas government itself \\ncould manage only 40,000 hectares of planned burning in 1997-98 and I \\nhad the same experience myself when I was minister in the very dry and \\nhot 2006 year.   The royal commission itself acknowledged that planned burning is \\nrisky and only available in limited timeframes. The royal commission \\nalso recommended that the Victorian government appoint an independent \\nperson to monitor the implementation of its recommendations. The former \\npolice chief commissioner Neil Comrie was appointed to the role and in \\nhis reports in 2012 and 2013 recommended that the planned burning target\\n of 5% be replaced. Comrie concluded that the 5% was not aachievable, \\naffordable or sustainablea and recommended that it be replaced by a \\nrisk-based approach with a primary focus on human life and safety.   Following Comrieas reports, the Inspector General of Emergency \\nManagement recommended a change from a hectare-based target for planned \\nburns to a risk reduction target. A group of fire experts from around \\nthe country reviewed this recommendation and backed the changed approach\\n because it focuses on the areas of highest risk rather than on burning \\nbroad acres for the sake of meeting a target. The risk-based approach \\nalso creates incentives to pursue alternative forms of risk reduction \\nsuch as mowing and slashing when planned burning is not possible.   In 2016, the Victorian government agreed to adopt this new approach, \\nwhich means that fuel reduction is now done in a way to maximise the \\nreduction in risk to people and their homes rather than simply burning \\nas many hectares as possible. Fuel reduction burns are now carefully \\nplanned using computer-based fire models that indicate where the burning\\n is likely to be most effective. The target is to reduce the risk that \\nhomes will be lost by 30%, which experts advised is the right level \\nacross the state.   Planned burns cannot guarantee that homes will be saved. They are \\nmost effective when the fire is at ground level, but they are of limited\\n effect on the most dangerous fire weather days when a fire can race \\nacross tree crowns or across already burnt areas.   Fuel reduction burns should be part of the toolkit that our \\nfirefighting agencies have to tackle the ever-growing risk of bushfire. \\nThey should not be used as a weapon in the culture wars in order to \\ndivert attention from the need to act on climate change.

Modern government \\noffice blocks in the Australian capital Canberra have been closed \\nbecause the air inside is too dangerous for civil servants to breathe.    The sun has glowed an eerie red behind a brown shrouded sky for weeks\\n over Australian metropolitan areas that usually rank high in the \\nworldas most livable cities indexes.    Itas an unprecedented dilemma for Australians accustomed to blue \\nskies and sunny days that has raised fears for the long-term health \\nconsequences if prolonged exposure to choking smoke becomes the new \\nsummer norm. Similar concerns over smoke are emerging in other regions \\nof the globe being impacted by more fires tied to climate change, \\nincluding the Western U.S.   aIam going to give birth any day now, literally, and Iam going to \\nhave a newborn baby that Iam going to protect from all this,a said Emma \\nMauch, a pregnant Canberra mother.    Her friend, Sonia Connor, described the struggle of keeping her own \\nenergetic 3-year-old daughter contained inside their Canberra house with\\n windows and doors sealed by tape as the outside temperature exceeded 42\\n degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit). Itas a choice between air \\nflow in stifling heat or keeping potentially toxic smoke out.   aMy daughter hasnat shown any sort of symptoms, letas say. For me, I \\ncan feel it in my lungs, my throat has felt weird,a Connor said.   aIt doesnat seem to be stopping her, but the long-term effects? Who \\nknows? Sheas 3. Who knows whatas going to happen?a she added.   Slovenian tennis player Dalila Jakupovic fell to her knees in a \\ncoughing fit on Wednesday while competing in a qualifying match for the \\nAustralian Open in Melbourne.   aIave never experienced something like this,a Jakupovic told Australian Broadcasting Corp.   aWe are used to pollution a like, we play in China and more polluted \\ncountries a but this smoke is something different that for sure weare \\nnot used to.a    Canberra as well as Australiaas two largest cities, Sydney and \\nMelbourne, have at various times in recent weeks rated as the most \\npolluted cities in the world, although some argue the industrial \\npollutants in places such as New Delhi are more dangerous than wood \\nsmoke.   The fires have claimed at least 27 lives since September, destroyed \\nmore than 2,600 homes and razed more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 \\nmillion acres), mostly in New South Wales state. The area burned is \\nlarger than the U.S. state of Indiana.   Hospital admissions have increased in the smoke-affected cities, with\\n some patients suffering asthma for the first time in their lives. The \\ngovernment has responded by distributing 3.5 million free \\nparticle-excluding masks.   Acting Australian Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said he was \\ndiscussing with the government launching a study of the long-term health\\n implications of the wildfire smoke.   Bruce Thompson, president of the Thoracic Society of Australia and \\nNew Zealand, is among the respiratory disease experts who predict \\nincreases in heart and lung diseases as well as some cancers if climate \\nchange makes prolonged exposure to wildfire smoke an annual phenomenon.   aWeare breathing in stuff that the lungs donat like that leads to \\nsignificant changes, especially people who are predisposed to \\nrespiratory conditions,a Thompson said.   Thompson, who suffers itchy eyes and a running nose from smoke at \\nhome in Melbourne, said comparisons could be drawn between the current \\ncrisis and a wildfire that ignited coal in the open-cut Hazelwood mine \\nnear the town of Morwell in Victoria state in 2014. The fire burned for \\n45 days, blanketing Morwell and its 14,000 residents in thick smoke and \\ncoal dust.   That exposure was still taking tolls on the health of the Morwell \\ncommunity and the wider Latrobe Valley, particularly the young, Thompson\\n said.   Brian Oliver, head of the Respiratory Molecular Pathogenesis at \\nUniversity of Technology Sydney, likened prolonged and repeated exposure\\n to such wildfire smoke to smoking cigarettes.    Oliver predicted increases in smoker diseases across Australia if the\\n wildfire smoke became more common in a drier and hotter future.   NASA says the unprecedented masses of Australian smoke that have \\ndrifted east across the Pacific Ocean have returned after \\ncircumnavigating the globe.   In the U.S., an estimated 20,000 premature deaths now occur annually \\ndue to chronic wildfire smoke exposure. Thatas expected to double by the\\n end of the century, according to scientists funded by NASA, as tens of \\nmillions of people get exposed to massive asmoke wavesa emanating from \\nblazes in Western states.   Experts say an increase in serious health problems in California may \\nbe almost inevitable for vulnerable residents as the disasters become \\nmore commonplace.   Research suggests children, the elderly and those with existing health problems are most at risk.   Short-term exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen existing asthma and \\nlung disease, leading to emergency room treatment or hospitalization, \\nstudies have shown. Increases in doctor visits or hospital treatment for\\n respiratory infections, bronchitis and pneumonia in otherwise healthy \\npeople also have been found during and after wildfires.   Some studies also have found increases in ER visits for heart attacks\\n and strokes in people with existing heart disease on heavy smoke days \\nduring previous California wildfires, echoing research on potential \\nrisks from urban air pollution.   For most healthy people, exposure to wildfire smoke is just an \\nannoyance, causing burning eyes, scratchy throats or chest discomfort \\nthat all disappear when the smoke clears.   Wood smoke contains some of the same toxic chemicals as urban air \\npollution, along with tiny particles of vapor and soot 30 times thinner \\nthan a human hair. These can infiltrate the bloodstream, potentially \\ncausing inflammation and blood vessel damage even in healthy people, \\nresearch on urban air pollution has shown. Studies have linked heart \\nattacks and cancer with long-term exposure to air pollution.   Whether exposure to wildfire smoke carries the same risks is \\nuncertain, and determining harm from smog versus wildfire smoke can be \\ntricky. There is little known about the long-term effects of wildfire \\nsmoke because of difficulties in studying populations years after a \\nwildfire.   Michael Abramson, professor of epidemiology and preventive medicine \\nat Melbourneas Monash University, is a co-author of a report on the \\nongoing investigation of the health impacts of the Hazelwood blaze.   Abramson urges a national study of the health impacts of the latest \\nwildfires, saying his research focused on a much smaller population of \\n74,000 people in the Latrobe Valley.   aWeare now seeing substantial exposure extending over weeks to cities\\n that have millions of inhabitants, so I think itas very likely that \\nthere might be more subtle effects that we havenat been able to detect,a\\n Abramson said.

', ' CANBERRA, Australia a Fire alarms have been sounding in high-rise buildings across downtown Sydney and Melbourne as  dense smoke from distant wildfires \\n confuse electronic sensors. Modern government office blocks in the \\nAustralian capital Canberra have been closed because the air inside is \\ntoo dangerous for civil servants to breathe.   The sun has glowed an\\n eerie red behind a brown shrouded sky for weeks over Australian \\nmetropolitan areas that usually rank high in the worldas most livable \\ncities indexes.   Itas an unprecedented dilemma for Australians \\naccustomed to blue skies and sunny days that has raised fears for the \\nlong-term health consequences if  prolonged exposure to choking smoke  becomes the new summer norm. Similar concerns over smoke are emerging in other regions of the globe being impacted by  more fires tied to climate change , including the Western U.S.   aIam\\n going to give birth any day now, literally, and Iam going to have a \\nnewborn baby that Iam going to protect from all this,a said Emma Mauch, a\\n pregnant Canberra mother.   Her friend, Sonia Connor, described the\\n struggle of keeping her own energetic 3-year-old daughter contained \\ninside their Canberra house with windows and doors sealed by tape as the\\n outside temperature exceeded 42 degrees Celsius (108 degrees \\nFahrenheit). Itas a choice between air flow in stifling heat or keeping \\npotentially toxic smoke out.   aMy daughter hasnat shown any sort of\\n symptoms, letas say. For me, I can feel it in my lungs, my throat has \\nfelt weird,a Connor said.   aIt doesnat seem to be stopping her, but\\n the long-term effects? Who knows? Sheas 3. Who knows whatas going to \\nhappen?a she added.   Slovenian tennis player  Dalila Jakupovic fell to her knees in a coughing fit  on Wednesday while competing in a qualifying match for the Australian Open in Melbourne.   aIave never experienced something like this,a Jakupovic told Nine Network television.   aWe\\n are used to pollution a like, we play in China and more polluted \\ncountries a but this smoke is something different that for sure weare \\nnot used to.a   Canberra as well as Australiaas two largest cities, \\nSydney and Melbourne, have at various times in recent weeks rated as the\\n most polluted cities in the world, although some argue the industrial \\npollutants in places such as New Delhi are more dangerous than wood \\nsmoke.   Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.   The\\n fires have claimed at least 28 lives since September, destroyed more \\nthan 2,600 homes and razed more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million\\n acres), mostly in New South Wales state. The area burned is larger than\\n the U.S. state of Indiana.   Victoria state increased its official  fire death toll \\n by one to five on Wednesday when it reclassified the death of a fire \\nmanagement contractor in a traffic accident in November as a victim of \\nthe current wildfire crisis.   Hospital admissions have increased in\\n the smoke-affected cities, with some patients suffering asthma for the \\nfirst time in their lives. The government has responded by distributing \\n3.5 million free particle-excluding masks.   Acting Australian Chief\\n Medical Officer Paul Kelly said he was discussing with the government \\nlaunching a study of the long-term  health implications of the wildfire smoke .   Bruce\\n Thompson, president of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New \\nZealand, is among the respiratory disease experts who predict increases \\nin heart and lung diseases as well as some cancers if climate change \\nmakes prolonged exposure to wildfire smoke an annual phenomenon.   aWeare\\n breathing in stuff that the lungs donat like that leads to significant \\nchanges, especially people who are predisposed to respiratory \\nconditions,a Thompson said.   Thompson, who suffers itchy eyes and a\\n running nose from smoke at home in Melbourne, said comparisons could be\\n drawn between the current crisis and a wildfire that ignited coal in \\nthe open-cut Hazelwood mine near the town of Morwell in Victoria state \\nin 2014. The fire burned for 45 days, blanketing Morwell and its 14,000 \\nresidents in thick smoke and coal dust.   That\\n exposure was still taking tolls on the health of the Morwell community \\nand the wider Latrobe Valley, particularly the young, Thompson said.   Brian\\n Oliver, head of the Respiratory Molecular Pathogenesis at University of\\n Technology Sydney, likened prolonged and repeated exposure to such \\nwildfire smoke to smoking cigarettes.   Oliver predicted increases \\nin smoker diseases across Australia if the wildfire smoke became more \\ncommon in a drier and hotter future.   NASA says the unprecedented \\nmasses of Australian smoke that have drifted east across the Pacific \\nOcean have returned after circumnavigating the globe.   In the U.S.,\\n an estimated 20,000 premature deaths now occur annually due to chronic \\nwildfire smoke exposure. Thatas expected to double by the end of the \\ncentury, according to scientists funded by NASA, as tens of millions of \\npeople get exposed to massive asmoke wavesa emanating from blazes in \\nWestern states.   Experts say an increase in  serious health problems in California  may be almost inevitable for vulnerable residents as the disasters become more commonplace.   Research suggests children, the elderly and those with existing health problems are most at risk.   Short-term\\n exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen existing asthma and lung disease,\\n leading to emergency room treatment or hospitalization, studies have \\nshown. Increases in doctor visits or hospital treatment for respiratory \\ninfections, bronchitis and pneumonia in otherwise healthy people also \\nhave been found during and after wildfires.   Some studies also have\\n found increases in ER visits for heart attacks and strokes in people \\nwith existing heart disease on heavy smoke days during previous \\nCalifornia wildfires, echoing research on potential risks from urban air\\n pollution.   For most healthy people, exposure to wildfire smoke is\\n just an annoyance, causing burning eyes, scratchy throats or chest \\ndiscomfort that all disappear when the smoke clears.   Wood smoke \\ncontains some of the same toxic chemicals as urban air pollution, along \\nwith tiny particles of vapor and soot 30 times thinner than a human \\nhair. These can infiltrate the bloodstream, potentially causing \\ninflammation and blood vessel damage even in healthy people, research on\\n urban air pollution has shown. Studies have linked heart attacks and \\ncancer with long-term exposure to air pollution.   Whether exposure \\nto wildfire smoke carries the same risks is uncertain, and determining \\nharm from smog versus wildfire smoke can be tricky. There is little \\nknown about the long-term effects of wildfire smoke because of \\ndifficulties in studying populations years after a wildfire.   Michael\\n Abramson, professor of epidemiology and preventive medicine at \\nMelbourneas Monash University, is a co-author of a report on the ongoing\\n investigation of the health impacts of the Hazelwood blaze.   Abramson\\n urges a national study of the health impacts of the latest wildfires, \\nsaying his research focused on a much smaller population of 74,000 \\npeople in the Latrobe Valley.   aWeare now seeing substantial \\nexposure extending over weeks to cities that have millions of \\ninhabitants, so I think itas very likely that there might be more subtle\\n effects that we havenat been able to detect,a Abramson said.

Four\\n people were killed and dozens arrested last week in the northern \\nvillage of Dong Tam near the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, as a \\nlong-running land dispute flared after a dawn raid by police.   Authorities\\n said villagers attacked the troops with hand grenades, petrol bombs and\\n knives, and were responsible for the deaths of the three policemen and a\\n village leader.   Dong Tam residents said the police used excessive force.   This\\n week, authorities said 22 of those arrested would face murder charges, \\nand clamped down on social media posts about the clashes. Several \\nactivists have also been arrested for posts related to the incident, \\naccording to Amnesty International.   \"Social media is absolutely \\ncritical to land rights in Vietnam,\" Amnesty\\'s regional director \\nNicholas Bequelin told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Thursday.   \"With\\n neither independent media nor an independent judicial system, it is the\\n only way to create significant pressure outside the community,\" he \\nsaid, adding that the censorship was an \"unacceptable\" attack on freedom\\n of expression.   A spokesman for Vietnam\\'s ministry of information and communications did not respond to requests for comment.   The ministry of public security previously said it had launched an investigation into the clash.   Vietnam\\'s\\n cybersecurity law that went into effect last January has been \\ncriticised by human rights activists for giving authorities the power to\\n censor expression and requiring service providers to take down any \\ncontent deemed to be offensive.   For several years, Dong Tam\\'s residents had protested what they said was the unfair seizure of land for a military airport.   Three\\n years ago, villagers held dozens of local officials and policemen \\ncaptive for several days after the arrest of several protesters. At the \\ntime, authorities had vowed to look into the dispute.   Social \\nmedia \"played an important role in mobilising public support\" for the \\nvillagers back in 2017 said John Gillespie, a professor at Australia\\'s \\nMonash University, and an expert on land conflicts in Vietnam.   The government appears to have moved quickly to prevent it from happening this time, he said.   \"This\\n case shows a worrying escalation in the level of force the government \\nis prepared to use to suppress local objections to public infrastructure\\n developments,\" Gillespie said.   Conflicts over land are common in\\n Vietnam, where farmland was forcibly redistributed in the 1970s during \\nCommunist rule in the north.   Since the ruling Communist Party \\nlaunched its economic reforms, or doi moi, in the late 1980s, more \\nfarming land has been taken to build highways and large industrial \\nzones, sparking conflicts despite recent legislation aimed at protecting\\n vulnerable communities.

The single mother of three, 52, who had to escort her 83-year-old \\nmother out of the 8.6-mile evacuation zone around the erupting Taal \\nvolcano in the Philippines, pleaded with her uncle, Anacleto, 80, to \\njoin their escape from Barangay Tulo in Batangas province, some 45 miles\\n from the capital, Manila.   aHe didnat want to go out of his house. I felt he was not aware of \\nthe danger he will face being alone when the whole town left already,a \\nshe said.   aMaybe heas weak and because of his past experience a few decades \\nback of the volcanic activities, he thought that he wonat be affected,a \\nshe added. aI called a local government rescue team to ask for their \\nhelp, but heas firm in his decision.a   Taal, a small but treacherous volcano that sits on a lake in a densely populated area, had been quiet for more than 40 years  when\\n it suddenly spewed a plume of steaming ash from its crater on Sunday, \\nin an eruption so huge that it could be spotted from space.     T he Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology \\n(Phivolcs) has since monitored close to 600 volcanic quakes and has \\nmaintained the second highest alert, meaning a hazardous eruption is \\npossible within hours to days.    L arge fissures have appeared in nearby towns, damaging \\nbuildings, and the institute recorded fresh adark grey ash plumesa of \\n500 and 800 metres early on Thursday morning.   Close to half a million people reside in the evacuation zone, and at \\nleast 50,000 are currently being housed in makeshift shelters, while \\nothers like Ms Cuento have managed to rent apartments in Manila or stay \\nwith family.   Some, like Uncle Anacleto, have risked staying with their homes, or \\nhave ventured back to salvage their belongings and rescue animals \\nblanketed in suffocating ash and thick mud.   Ms Cuento, who fears her bridal store may be looted, admits she was \\ntempted to remain until the mayor ordered a mandatory evacuation using \\nFacebook Live. aPeople were crying for help,a she said. aTrying to get \\nout was a struggle.

', '     Wildfire\\n smoke from the Australian bushfires has circumnavigated the Earth, \\naccording to data compiled by NASA satellites in orbit around our \\nplanet.   NASA scientists have been  tracking the trajectory of the smoke and aerosols \\n since late December using data from the NOAA/NASA Suomi NPP satellite, \\nlinking the devastation of the bushfires with \"unprecedented\" conditions\\n such as  searing heat and historic dryness .   These\\n conditions have caused an abnormally large number of fire-generated \\nthunderstorms known as pyrocumulonimbus events. Such thunderstorms have \\nsent the bushfire smoke high into the atmosphere, helping to kickstart \\nits journey around the world.   \"Pyrocumulonimbus events provide a pathway for smoke to reach the stratosphere  more than 10 miles in altitude ,\"\\n NASA wrote in a blog post last Thursday. \"Once in the stratosphere, the\\n smoke can travel thousands of miles from its source, affecting \\natmospheric conditions globally.\"       VIIRS\\n Red-Green-Blue imagery provides a atrue-colora view of the smoke.

While useful, it is often hard to \\ndistinguish smoke over clouds and, sometimes, over dark ocean surfaces.    (NASA/Colin Seftor)    This\\n smoke was lofted more than 9 miles high, NASA said. It drifted eastward\\n across the South Pacific into New Zealand, where it caused severe air \\nquality issues and visibly darkened mountaintop snow in the country \\nabout two weeks ago.   Andrew Mackintosh, head of the school of \\nEarth, atmosphere and environment at Monash University and former \\ndirector of the Antarctic Research Centre, estimated the dust could \\nincrease this seasonas glacier melt in New Zealand  by 20 to 30% .   aIt\\n is quite common for dust to be transported to New Zealand glaciers, but\\n I would say that the amount of transport right now is pretty phenomenal\\n a  I donat think Iave ever seen anything like it ,a Mackintosh told the Guardian on Jan. 1. aIt is concerning to me to see so much material being deposited on the glaciers.a   By early last week, the smoke had traveled halfway around the world, detected in parts of South America, some  7,500 miles from its source in Australia . Skies turned hazy, causing colorful sunrises and sunsets.   Now,\\n this week, that smoke has returned to Australia, completing its \\ncircumnavigation of the globe.

', '   Jan 20, 2020      Close         ESPN.com Staff Writer    Simon Cambers   As the  Australian Open \\n started play on Monday, tournament officials were still monitoring a \\npotential environmental crisis as a result of Australia\\'s ongoing \\nbushfires.   For all of the concerns about air quality, it turned \\nout that the biggest issue related to playing conditions on Day 1 was \\nheavy rain.   Last week, Tennis Australia boss and Australian Open \\ntournament director Craig Tiley said that when it becomes obvious that \\nsmoke could have an impact, officials are prepared to act for the \\nwelfare of all involved, including players, fans and staff. Tennis \\nAustralia said it will work with its medical team, the Bureau of \\nMeteorology and Environment Protection Authority Victoria scientists \\nwhen making decisions about whether it\\'s healthy to play.   Here are some frequently asked questions regarding the impact the bushfires could have on the first Grand Slam of the year:   Melbourne,\\n home of the Australian Open, is the capital and most populous city of \\nVictoria, one of the six states that make up Australia. The city is in \\nthe southeast corner of the country, along the coast where most people \\nlive and most of the bushfires have been burning. The major cities have \\nlargely been spared, but dense smoke has caused severe problems in some \\nplaces, such as the Australian capital of Canberra. An ATP Challenger \\nevent scheduled for Canberra in early January had to be moved about 400 \\nmiles west to Bendigo because of excessive smoke in the atmosphere.   On\\n Dec. 30, about 100,000 people were urged to flee five Melbourne suburbs\\n as a heat wave combined with high winds left the city suffocatingly hot\\n and dense with smoke. One firefighter was killed on the outlying \\ncountryside. While fire is the preeminent danger, smoke -- sometimes \\ndriven over great distances by wind -- is a more sinister threat that \\ncannot be fought.   The situation in the state of Victoria has forced  @vicemergency \\n (the state\\'s official alert system) to issue at least one recent \\nemergency warning of \"imminent\" danger from a bushfire for Noorinbee, \\n230 miles east of Melbourne. \"You are in danger and need to act \\nimmediately to survive,\" the warning said.   There\\n appears to be little danger from fires at the moment, but heat is \\nalways a factor Down Under. This year, smoke -- and the toxic elements \\nit carries -- is an active concern, especially in combination with the \\nfamiliar Melbourne heat.   The city has already closed a number of \\nbeaches and pools, sporting events have been canceled, and construction \\nworkers have been forced to abandon outdoor projects. Ambulance calls \\nfor people struggling to breathe have also risen significantly.   The\\n smoky days at the start of the new year spurred many people to purchase\\n P2 and N95 masks. The Australian Medical Association has advised people\\n with preexisting lung or heart conditions, as well as those sensitive \\nto smoke, to take special precautions. Many have purchased the common, \\nrelatively inexpensive, small respirators that slip over the nose and \\nmouth -- the ones commonly used by house painters, woodworkers and \\nothers. Visitors to Australia have been advised to bring their own.   In\\n a statement issued to the media on Jan. 6, Tiley said: \"There will be \\nmeteorological and air quality experts onsite to analyse all available \\nlive data and assess in real-time the air quality at Melbourne Park, and\\n we always work closely with our medical personnel and other local \\nexperts.\"   On Tuesday morning, with Melbourne\\'s air quality \\nofficially ranked third-worst in the world, Tiley and chief operating \\nofficer Tom Larner fronted a hastily arranged media opportunity to \\nassure that the tournament would act in the best interests of the \\nplayers, fans and staff.   \"This is a new experience for all of us in how we manage air quality, so we have to listen to the experts,\" Tiley said.   On\\n Friday, Australian Open organizers belatedly published details of their\\n \"Air Quality Policy,\" confirming that play at the first Grand Slam \\nevent of the year could be stopped if conditions are considered to be \\nadverse to players\\' health.   Responding to criticism from players \\nwho said they had not been fully informed earlier in the week, when \\nsmoke from the bushfires blew into Melbourne during the qualifying \\nevent, officials released the policy.   However, the decision of whether to stop play will still be largely at the discretion of the tournament referee.   The\\n Air Quality Rating (AQI) consists of five bands from one to five, \\n\"determined by analyzing concentrations of air pollutants at Melbourne \\nPark and in particular, the fine particulate matter rating (PM2.5).\"   Play\\n is allowed under the first three bands -- \"good\" (below 27), \"moderate\"\\n (27-62) and \"air may affect sensitive groups\" (62-97) -- but if the \\nlevel is between 97 and 200, \"match play may be suspended,\" though that \\nwill be up to the tournament referee.   If the rating is in the fifth band -- more than 200 -- then play will automatically be suspended.   The\\n publication of the policy came three days after organizers were heavily\\n criticized for allowing play to go on when a number of players \\ncomplained of breathing difficulties at the qualifying event.   The AQI reading from the station nearest Rod Laver Arena on Monday morning was 427, which is considered \"hazardous.\"   Tennis Australia has never had an air-quality policy because it has never before been a significant issue.   Due\\n to the constant threat of excessive heat, tournament officials have \\nestablished sophisticated protocols for measuring conditions, including \\nthe  WetBulb Globe Temperature  (WBGT), and the tournament has a transparent  extreme-heat policy  in place. It features a five-step  Australian Open heat-stress scale \\n that measures heat-related factors that trigger a variety of remedial \\nactions, from brief breaks to suspension of play sitewide.   Over \\nthe years, those protocols have evolved from a simple dictate in 1998 to\\n suspend play when the temperature hit 104 degrees Fahrenheit to a suite\\n of responses depending on the temperature and WBGT index (which takes \\nfactors other than temperature, including humidity, into consideration).\\n The measures include closing the roof on covered courts during day \\nmatches, heat-mandated 10-minute breaks between sets and stoppages of at\\n least two hours.   The athletes have various ways of dealing with \\nheat, including iced towels, appropriate headgear, misting fans, \\nfrequent changes of clothing and strategies that include prematch \\nhydration at hourly intervals, salt tablets, etc. But there\\'s little \\nthat anyone can do to help the air quality. Masks might help, but they \\nimpair oxygen intake. Inhalers that soothe sore throats might provide \\ntemporary relief from soreness, but they could also mask the damage \\nbeing done.   Both\\n the ATP and WTA have told ESPN.com that they are leaving decisions \\nabout the playing conditions in the hands of Tennis Australia. But \\nDjokovic told reporters that he put air-quality considerations on the \\nagenda at the annual player meeting that precedes the tournament.   That\\'s\\n a good idea, given Tennis Australia\\'s lack of a transparent mechanism \\nfor determining when to pull the plug on play due to hazardous air \\nquality.   While practicing in Melbourne during the worst days of smoke in early January,  Denis Kudla \\n told The New York Times, \"If it\\'s anything like yesterday, I don\\'t \\nthink it would be safe over a two-, three-week period. You could play \\n[in the Australian Open], but who knows what damage we\\'re actually \\ncausing ourselves? It can\\'t be good.\"   It\\n sounds far-fetched, but in a worst-case scenario, the Australian Open \\ncould become the first hybrid outdoor-indoor tournament. That\\'s because \\nthe National Tennis Center has four roofed stadiums as well as eight \\nindoor courts. The air circulation systems in the roofed venues include \\nsome filtration, but earlier this month in Sydney, the smoke overwhelmed\\n some air-conditioning units and triggered smoke alarms in some \\nbuildings. Tiley said, \"[We have] effectively weatherproofed the \\nAustralian Open.\"   We might yet see whether that also means they have smoke-proofed it.   Some\\n players struggled with breathing during qualifying last week, when the \\nair was among the worst in the world because of smoke from fires 100 \\nmiles away. On Monday, though, all appeared to be fine.   \"Today, it seemed normal,\"  Serena Williams  said after her first-round victory. \"Yeah, it seemed pretty good.\"   During\\n qualifiers, smoke and hazy conditions at Melbourne Park affected the \\nplayers, with organizers criticized for allowing matches to proceed. The\\n start of qualifying was delayed by an hour on Tuesday due to the smoky \\nhaze, but practice sessions were canceled.   A number of players complained, including Australian  Bernard Tomic , who sought medical treatment after he struggled to breathe during his first-round loss. Slovenia\\'s  Dalila Jakupovic  said she feared she would pass out before she retired from her match after collapsing to her knees with a coughing spell.   \"I\\n was really scared that I would collapse,\" Jakupovic said. \"That\\'s why I\\n went onto the floor -- because I couldn\\'t walk anymore.\"   Australian\\n Open officials delayed play by three hours during qualifiers on \\nWednesday, but the air-quality index was still graded as \"unhealthy\" \\nwhen the players took to the court.   On Thursday, British player  Liam Broady  accused Australian Open officials of treating qualifiers worse than animals. Calls are growing among players to form a union.   Tiley\\n addressed the criticism from players saying: \"Our medical team were \\nsatisfied with the conditions that the players were competing in [in \\nqualifying], per all of the research and the data and the science that \\nthey have.   \"But they also make an assessment. You could have been \\ntwo hours into those matches and have 25 people presenting themselves \\nwith a medical condition that may be related to the pollutants.\"   The\\n ATP and WTA Player Councils met separately on Friday in Melbourne, with\\n smoke and playing conditions high on the agenda at both.   Despite the concerns, many of the top tennis players have vowed to support Australians suffering because of the bushfires.    Nick Kyrgios \\n got the ball rolling when he pledged to donate $140 (U.S.) for every \\nace he hit during the ATP Cup. Scores of ATP and WTA players followed \\nsuit. Williams donated her $43,000 ASB Classic winner\\'s check to \\nAustralian wildfires victims. The ATP donated $725,000 on behalf of the \\nplayers, and the ITF will contribute an additional $400,000.    Roger Federer ,  Rafael Nadal ,\\n Kyrgios, Williams and others took part in a Rally for Relief bushfire \\ncharity exhibition at Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday. According to Tennis \\nAustralia, the event raised nearly $3.5 million for the bushfire relief \\neffort. The event drew a capacity crowd of more than 15,000. During the \\nevent, Nadal announced that he and Federer would combine to donate \\n$250,000. Despite the drive to support the bushfire victims.   During\\n Saturday\\'s media day, Federer led a chorus of criticism of tournament \\norganizers for their handling of events earlier this week. Federer said \\nhe had made a point of going to see tournament officials when conditions\\n were at their worst to try to find out the rules.   \"I said, \\'I think we\\'re all confused. Is it super unsafe, or is it totally safe to play?\\'\" he said.   Nadal\\n said he also consulted tournament officials and was content with their \\nexplanation, but other players were more forthright in their criticism.   Canadian  Denis Shapovalov \\n said the players had been \"left in the dark,\" it was \"scary,\" and he \\nwould refuse to play if he felt the conditions were unsafe, regardless \\nof what the tournament says.    Information from the Associated Press, AAP and Reuters contributed to this report.   ', ' A\\n smartwatch band with integrated electrodes to produce an \\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) might be able to help detect atrial \\nfibrillation, but not as well as a traditional ECG machine used in a \\nhospital, a recent study suggests.     Researchers compared results \\nfor 200 people who had ECGas done using both an FDA-approved smartwatch \\nheart rhythm monitor called the AliveCor KardiaBand and a traditional \\nECG machine used in many doctorsa offices and hospitals.     The \\nband was manufactured to be used with Apple smartwatches. AliveCor \\ndoesnat sell them anymore, but many people are still using them.    When\\n the band predicted atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm \\nirregularity, it was correct about 55% of the time, the study found. And\\n when the band predicted that people did not have atrial fibrillation, \\nit was right about 98% of the time.     aBased on these findings, at\\n this stage it would be recommended that healthcare professionals remain\\n an integral part of the use of such technology in order to avoid \\nunnecessary treatment and anxiety,a said lead study author Dr. Kevin \\nRajakariar of Box Hill Hospital and Monash University in Victoria, \\nAustralia in an email. aAlthough there is potential for population \\nscreening for atrial fibrillation and monitoring atrial fibrillation \\nburden in those already diagnosed, at this stage, further studies are \\nrequired to define the precise role of these devices within the \\nhealthcare system.a    In atrial fibrillation, electrical impulses \\nin the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic, causing the heart muscle\\n to quiver rather than contracting normally. As a result, blood doesnat \\nmove as well through the heart. This can lead to formation of clots that\\n can travel through the arteries to the brain and cause a stroke.    The\\n wearable band produces an ECG reading when people who have it on a \\nwrist place a finger from the opposite hand on an electrode on top of \\nthe band. This creates a circuit with an electrode on the back of the \\nwatch thatas in contact with the skin.     Wearable devices like the\\n smartwatch band that works with the Apple watch to take ECGs and detect\\n heart rhythm disorders like atrial fibrillation are becoming \\nincreasingly popular with consumers, researchers note in Heart.     If\\n proven to be accurate, these devices have the potential to be used to \\nscreen for heart rhythm disorders like atrial fibrillation at the \\npopulation level, potentially identifying people who need to start \\ntaking blood thinners to lower their risk of stroke, the study team \\nnotes.     In the current study, researchers concluded that the \\nsmartwatch band with the ECG ademonstrated moderate diagnostic accuracya\\n when compared to a traditional EGC.     One limitation of the study\\n is that participants had a much higher prevalence of atrial \\nfibrillation than the general population, at 19% compared with just \\n2%-5% by most population estimates, the study team notes.     Itas \\nalso possible that results might be less accurate at predicting atrial \\nfibrillation when used by consumers on their own, outside the context of\\n a clinical trial where they got support from researchers in using the \\ndevice, the study team also points out.     aRecording and analyzing\\n the rhythm using wearables could be an asset for the management of \\npatients with atrial fibrillation,a said Dr. Khaldoun Tarakji, director \\nof the Heart and Vascular Institute Center for Digital Health \\nTechnologies and Telemedicine at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.     Wearables\\n like the band in this study might help diagnose patients who have \\nintermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation, Tarakji, who wasnat \\ninvolved in the study, said by email. They might also help monitor \\npatients with the condition to determine what treatment they need or \\nfollow their symptoms after treatment.    aHowever, the concern with\\n widespread use of these wearables among asymptomatic patients is the \\npossibility of false positive results that can trigger more testing and \\nunnecessary interventions,a Tarakji said.

', \" Smoke hung thick in the air and shrubland was\\n still smouldering when firefighters escorted a small team of biologists\\n into Kosciusko National Park in southern New South Wales on 15 January.   The\\n expedition, granted a rare exemption from the parkas strict no-go \\npolicy during this record-breaking fire season, was to prevent one of \\nAustraliaas rarest fish from going extinct.   Rain forecast for the \\nfollowing day threatened to wash ash from the fires into the mountain \\nstreams, smothering the last remaining  Galaxias tantangara , a \\nspecies of mountain minnow found in a single three-kilometre stretch of \\nthe Tantangara Creek. The expeditioners collected 142 fish as an \\ninsurance population to be bred in captivity, a first for the species, \\nin case it disappears in the wild.   aIn this situation, theyare \\nmore important than koalas, [because] weare not going to lose koalas \\nwith the fires,a says Mark Lintermans, from the University of Canberra, \\nwho has been studying the finger-sized fish since their discovery in \\n2014.   As blazes of unprecedented size continue to rage across \\nAustralia, the full extent of the devastation is still unknown. \\nFire-affected regions remain off-limits to all but a few researchers due\\n to safety risks, but some, having consulted satellite images and fire \\nmaps, fear the worst.   Some studies have been set back months or \\nyears. Destroyed scientific equipment and derailed research projects \\nmust be added to the calamitous toll of lives, homes and businesses \\nlost.   Remote sensing specialist, Will Woodgate, from the \\nUniversity of Queensland, manages a site in the Bago State Forest in the\\n alpine region of southeast Australia, as part of Terrestrial Ecosystem \\nResearch Network (TERN), a nationwide array that gathers data on land \\nsurface conditions to feed into global climate models.   A 70-metre \\ntower at the centre of the site, one of 20 in the network, is connected \\nto sensors and equipment with a combined value of $A500,000. As fire \\ntore through the site at 3 pm on New Yearas Eve, the stream of data that\\n has flowed from there for 20 years stopped.   Photos of the site \\nfrom the NSW Forestry Corporation show that the understory of the forest\\n has been wiped out, but the canopy is intact. The tower still stands, \\nso sensors at the top of the tower could have survived the blaze, says \\nWoodgate.   But power cables and two shipping container storage \\nunits housing computers, a battery bank and communications equipment are\\n scorched.   aAll our equipment inside those sheds could have been melted,a says Woodgate.   The\\n siteas generator and on-ground sensors may also be destroyed. The \\nrepair bill could top $100,000, says Woodgate, not to mention the time \\nand effort required to get the site back up and running. It could be \\nmonths before scientists get the go-ahead to even physically assess the \\ndamage, he says.   A handful of the 700 TERN sites without permanent\\n infrastructure a on Kangaroo Island off the coast of southern \\nAustralia, for instance a have also been burnt.   Ecologist,\\n Ross Crates, from the Australian National University, studies the \\ncritically endangered Regent Honeyeater, a petite nomadic bird with \\nfewer than 400 individuals remaining in the wild.   Finding and \\ncounting the honeyeaters has just got a lot harder because fires may \\nhave wiped out about 20% of their habitat, forests in the Greater Blue \\nMountains World Heritage Site, says Crates. He thinks it could take \\nyears before the fate of the honeyeater is known.   If the bird has \\nshifted to new habitat as a result of the fires, ait almost puts us back\\n to square one,a he says. aItas pretty heart-breaking.a   For \\nresearchers working directly with species affected, fires can exact an \\nemotional toll, wildlife ecologist, Euan Ritchie, from Deakin University\\n points out. aIt's almost like a member of your family being very \\nstrongly adversely affected, so people take that pretty hard,a he \\nsays.regent honeyeater   Aquatic ecologist, Ross Thompson, from the \\nUniversity of Canberra says that he has spent the past few days \\ncounselling students whose research has been affected by the fire.   aIf\\n you're trying to do a three and a half year PhD and you have a big fire\\n in the middle of it, it can have a pretty significant effect on whether\\n you've got enough data to get done,a he says.Research delayed   Plant\\n ecophysiologist, Ros Gleadow, of Monash University in Melbourne, says \\nthe fire could delay one of her experiments by several years. A site in \\nEast Gippsland, in southeast Australia, home to the southern-most \\npopulation of a native species of sorghum, Sorghum leiocladum, has been \\nburnt.   The wild relative of commercially cultivated sorghum, being\\n investigated for useful genes, may return, but not in time for one of \\nGleadowas students to collect data on it for his PhD thesis.   aEven\\n if it comes back, we won't have the funding or the opportunity to do \\nthis experiment again probably for a few years,a she says. Seeds from \\nthe population havenat yet been added to a dedicated seed bank, \\nunderlining the importance of such facilities in safeguarding against \\nthe loss of species, she says.   Research at the newly established \\nAustralian Mountain Research Facility lead by the Australian National \\nUniversity in Canberra has also been postponed. The multi-institutional \\nfacility, which is set to study the effects of a changing climate on \\nalpine landscapes, had planned to deploy sensors and monitoring \\nequipment to its eight field sites this summer.   Fire at one of \\nthose sites, in the Snowy Mountains, has left anothing but bare soil,a \\nsays soil scientist Zach Brown from Australian National University in \\nCanberra and the senior technical officer for the project. With fires \\nstill threatening other sites, installation of equipment across the \\nnetwork has been set back by a year, says Brown.   As\\n ruinous as the fires have been, ecologists are preparing to make the \\nmost of the situation. aDisturbances are one of the ways we learn about \\necology best,a says Thompson.   On 10 January, ecologists in \\nVictoria met to discuss the extent of the damage across the state. \\nAccording to a government report from the meeting leaked to The Age \\nnewspaper, fires have incinerated large chunks of habitat for several \\nendangered species in south-eastern Australia, including the sooty owl, \\nthe long-nosed bandicoot, and the diamond python.   The fires \\npresent an opportunity to ramp up management of introduced herbivores \\nsuch as deer and pigs while numbers are down and tree cover has been \\nopened up, exposing them for aerial shooting, says Ritchie, who attended\\n the meeting.   Ecologist, Michael Clarke, from La Trobe University \\nin Melbourne ,is experienced at creating gains from fire losses. Clarke \\nhad been studying mating systems in birds when in 2003, fires burnt \\nthrough his field sites on Wilsonas Promontory in southeast Australia.   aIn\\n my case, it changed my research direction in a productive way,a says \\nClarke. He turned to investigating how fire management, including \\ncontrolled burns to reduce fire hazard, affects ecosystems. aThe more I \\ndelved into the ecological basis of fire management, the less confident I\\n was that it was based on really good science,a says Clarke.   Heas been trying to fill that gap ever since.  \", '      \\n   Hope for an effective and inexpensive treatment for the deadly \\ncondition sepsis has dimmed following results of a major new study.   Researchers\\n had hoped that a simple treatment involving infusions of vitamin C, \\nvitamin B1 and steroids would work against a disease that kills an \\nestimated 270,000 people each year in the United States and 11 million \\nglobally. Sepsis, or blood poisoning, occurs when the body overreacts to\\n infection. It leads to leaky blood vessels, which can cause multiple \\norgan failure.   Excitement about this treatment took off in \\nearly 2017, when a well-regarded physician and researcher in Norfolk, \\nVa., Dr. Paul Marik,  reported that he had remarkable results \\n treating his sepsis patients using this combination of agents. Some \\ndoctors in intensive care units started using the method immediately, \\nbased on those early results. Many others said they wanted to wait for \\nresults of a more carefully controlled study         The largest scientific study published to date has now reported \\nits findings. It finds no benefit at all from the \"Marik cocktail.\" It \\ninvolved more than 200 patients in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. \\nResults were  presented Friday at a meeting  in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and were  published online Friday in   JAMA , the journal of the American Medical Association.    Dr. Rinaldo Bellomo ,\\n at Austin Hospital and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, led \\nthe research team. He decided to study the treatment because sepsis \\ntakes such a large toll a it\\'s a leading cause of death in hospitals a \\nand treatment options are limited. There\\'s no effective drug, though \\naggressive use of antibiotics and careful care in the ICU can help.   \"People\\n latch on to promising interventions because of that frustration,\" he \\ntells NPR. \"And it\\'s understandable. But, you know, the view from here \\nis that we shouldn\\'t substitute hope for evidence.\"   His evidence does not support those who believe the vitamin C treatment is effective.   \"It is discouraging,\" says  Dr. Craig Coopersmith ,\\n interim director of the Emory Critical Care Center at Emory University.\\n \"Right now, sepsis is the number three cause of death in the United \\nStates and the number one or two cause of death in the world.\"    Coopersmith\\n says the results don\\'t slam the door on the treatment entirely a \\nthere\\'s still some chance that it has a modest effect on overall \\nsurvival, he says, but the study didn\\'t involve enough patients to \\nanswer that question. The study found no effect on short-term survival \\nor improvement in certain clinical markers of disease.   \"I don\\'t\\n think we can yet say that there is no impact,\" Coopersmith says. \"I \\nthink we could say that the jury\\'s still out on that.\"   He \\nassumes that doctors who are inclined toward using the treatment will \\ncontinue to do so, at least for now, while those who adopted a \\nwait-and-see approach are sticking with that.    Indeed, Marik, \\nwho remains a strong proponent of this approach, rejects the findings of\\n the study. He tells NPR that by his reckoning, patients in the study \\nreceived treatment far too late in the course of their disease. \"It\\'s \\nlike giving it to a patient who\\'s dead,\" he says. \"It\\'s of no benefit. \\nThe horse was out of the barn miles beforehand.\"   Marik, at \\nEastern Virginia Medical School, gives his patients the vitamin C \\ninfusion as quickly as he recognizes signs of sepsis. That\\'s impossible \\nto do in a study in which participants must be enrolled in a study and \\nthen randomized into one of the two comparison groups before treatment \\ncan begin.   \"The question is, why does this study not replicate \\nreal-life experience and the experience of hundreds of clinicians around\\n the world?\" he asks.   Marik says in his experience, the \\ntreatment is only effective if given within six hours after someone has \\nsuspected sepsis. At the meeting in Belfast, Dr. Tomoko Fujii, on the \\nstudy research team at Monash University, said they provided treatment \\nan average of 12 hours after patients arrived in the intensive care \\nunit. Patients came from a variety of locations, including the emergency\\n room, and she said they have no information about how long they had \\nbeen septic before arriving at the ICU.   Coopersmith is part of  a larger study \\n a involving 501 patients a that has also put the vitamin C protocol to \\nthe test. That research group has completed collecting data and is now \\nin the process of analyzing the results and preparing a publication. A \\nsecond group, coordinated out of Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel \\nDeaconess Medical Center,  also studied the protocol  among a group of about 200 patients.   Findings\\n from those studies should help doctors and researchers come to a more \\ndefinitive conclusion, says Bellomo in Australia. \"I think that will be \\nreally good, because we would have a much larger body of evidence. I \\nhope by the end of 2020 to provide more nuanced and more detailed views \\nof what happens with this kind of intervention.\"    You can contact NPR Science Correspondent Richard Harris at    rharris@npr.org   .

FILE\\n PHOTO: Tennis - Australian Open Previews - Melbourne, Australia - \\nJanuary 16, 2020   General view of flags infront of the Melbourne \\nSkyline   REUTERS/Ciro De Luca/File Photo    The\\n Australian Open, the seasonas first Grand Slam, starts later on Monday \\nbut the lead-up was blighted by smoke from bushfires that have raged \\nacross Australia for months.    Slovenian Daria Jakupovic said she \\nwas ascareda after a coughing fit forced her out of qualifying on \\nTuesday while Canadian Denis Shapovalov said he would refuse to play \\nthis week if forced to compete when the air quality was poor.    The\\n Monash University report, titled aLove 40, degreesa, said extreme heat \\nand weather events would have a growing impact on sport in Australia.    aThis\\n is not something that has happened,a James Goldie, the reportas \\nco-author, told Reuters. aThis is something that is happening. And itas \\ngoing to get worse.a    Goldie and co-author Stephanie Hall examined\\n the effects of climate change on three high-profile sports events held \\nin the Australian summer a the Boxing Day cricket test in Melbourne, \\ncyclingas Tour Down Under in South Australia, and the Australian Open \\ntennis Grand Slam.    The reports all indicated that sports \\norganizations should consider shifting their events to either November \\nor March, or modifying their times to start earlier in the morning or \\ncompete later at night.    aIt doesnat matter what sport youare \\nplaying, there are multiple tracks of evidence that summer sports across\\n the board are going to be impacted by climate change and extreme heat,a\\n Hall said.    Sports organizations have adopted extreme heat \\npolicies but in recent years Tennis Australia has been criticized for \\nnot postponing play when players were showing signs of distress.    Novak\\n Djokovic retired from his quarter-final in 2009 due to heat stress \\nwhile defending the title as the temperature hit 45 Celsius (113 \\nFahrenheit).    In 2018, Franceas Alize Cornet collapsed when court \\nsurface temperatures reached 69 Celsius, while her compatriot Gael \\nMonfils said he felt like he was adyinga.    The\\n bushfire crisis has put pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison as \\ncritics say he has not done enough to address the impact of climate \\nchange, which meteorologists have said was extending the length of the \\nfire weather season.    Bushfires are common in Australia but the \\nfire season has begun much earlier than usual, with temperatures soaring\\n above 40 Celsius well ahead of the start of the southern summer and \\nhigh winds hitting the drought-parched landscape.    Morrison on \\nFriday again rejected any links between the fires and his conservative \\ngovernmentas policies, including support for the coal industry.    Gavan\\n McFadzean, the Climate Change Program Manager at the Australian \\nConservation Foundation, which commissioned the research, said it should\\n serve as a wake-up call for sports organizations to do more to address \\nclimate change.    aTheyare not doing enough,a he said. aTheyare not\\n ... pushing for stronger ambition from our political and business \\nleaders on climate change.    aSport is a critical institution and plays an important role in bringing people together and shifting community attitudes.    aThere has never been a more important role that sport can play.a    Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Peter Rutherford  ', '    Published:    00:11 AEDT, 20 January 2020     |    Updated:    00:11 AEDT, 20 January 2020        The\\n Australian Open should be moved to a shoulder season or extended by a \\nweek to avoid extreme heat risks for players, Victorian researchers have\\n suggested.   Players have described the hot conditions at the \\nAustralian Open as brutal, while four-time winner Andre Agassi likened \\nthe experience to \"playing in a giant kiln\".   Monash University \\nresearchers have found health risks and match disruptions are an \\nincreasing risk because of climate change and that the event should \\nadapt to protect players.   They found Tennis Australia has an opportunity to make a statement to the world on climate action and to safeguard the event.   Moving\\n the Australian grand slam to November or March is one suggested option,\\n a report for the Australian Conservation Foundation released on Monday \\nsaid.   But that could cause immediate issues for tennis officials \\nand their jammed-packed schedule, while long-term modelling suggests \\ntemperatures in those months will be as high as they are currently in \\nJanuary, by 2060.   An alternative could be to extend the event by a week, reducing playing time during the hottest part of the day.

Tennis Australia last year \\nsigned on to the United Nation\\'s Sports for Climate Action Framework and\\n established a sustainability business unit to \"encourage a culture of \\nsustainability\" and plans to assess carbon impact during this year\\'s \\ntournament.   Researchers noted a \"significant increase\" in average\\n daytime temperatures and extreme heat days in the tournament\\'s 115-day \\nhistory.   The Australian Open became the first grand slam tournament to implement a heat policy in 1998.   It\\n was replaced last year with a new policy based on radiant heat, \\nhumidity, air temperature and wind speed data recorded around Melbourne \\nPark.   It uses increased hydration, cooling strategies and \\nextended breaks as steps to address heat stress before suspending play \\nin the worst conditions.   Researchers said Tennis Australia and \\nAustralian Open organisers declined to tell them whether they have a \\ntracking system for days when play was delayed or abandoned because of \\nextreme heat, per season.   Last year, play was suspended on one day. A year earlier, court surface temperatures reached 69C.   In\\n 2014, play continued on four days when temperatures were above 41C. \\nNine players withdrew and more than 1000 attendees were treated for \\nheat-related illnesses.

Advertisement    ', ' Australia is battling a bushfire crisis that has \\nleft more than two dozen people dead and burned 10 million hectares \\n(40,000 sq miles) of land.    The fires are expected to last for many weeks yet - and the recovery process will go on for many years.    So is it safe to travel to Australia? Were these fires caused by criminal arson? And what can we all do to help?    We answer some of your questions here.    This has been a huge talking point in recent weeks. And yes, some of the fires were due to arson,  as they are every year .    But the widely circulated figure of nearly 200 people arrested for deliberately starting fires is inaccurate.        Media playback is unsupported on your device    Police in New South Wales said in January 183 people had been charged since November 2019 \\n over \"bushfire-related offences\". Of those, 24 were accused of \\ndeliberately lighting fires. The rest were over failures to comply with \\ntotal fire bans - perhaps by lighting a campfire - or things such as \\ndiscarding cigarettes or matches.    In Victoria, police say there \\nis no evidence the huge East Gippsland or North East fires were caused \\nby arson or suspicious activity. Queensland Police say of the 1,068 \\nbushfires in the state since September, 114 (about 10%) have been \\n\"deliberately or maliciously lit through human involvement\".   Paul \\nRead, a lecturer and natural disasters expert at Monash University, \\nwrote in research published last November that in general, just under  90% of Australian bushfires were caused by human activity , which includes deliberate arson, carelessness or recklessness.   About 13% of the 62,000 fires a year in Australia are caused by lightning strikes, says Mr Read,  which is what sparked the massive Gospers Mountain blaze . And of course how a fire starts has little to no effect on how big it will become.    Australian\\n officials say anyone who wants to help should send money via official \\nfundraising websites. The Australian Red Cross, RSCPA and Salvation Army\\n are among the charities running special appeals. The largely volunteer \\nfire services also take donations.    What people in affected areas say they don\\'t need is\\n donations of food, clothing or other physical contributions. Emergency \\nofficials say they have no way of storing or distributing these items \\nand what people on the ground really need is cash.   Officials are \\nalso warning to be cautious - many fake charity pages have sprung up, \\nsome claiming to be in the name of people killed in fires. Officials in \\nVictoria have said some scammers are even cold-calling homes to solicit \\ndonations.    Australia is very big and  the government body Tourism Australia says: \"Many areas are unaffected and most tourism businesses are still open.\"  But it has suspended its UK ad campaign, featuring Kylie Minogue, while the fires are dominating the news.   It\\n says people visiting Australia should check the most recent advice \\nbefore departing and \"remain informed about changing conditions whilst \\non the ground\", through government agencies, the Bureau of Meteorology \\nand local tourism staff.    There\\'s no advice at present to avoid travelling to Australia.  The current guidance from the UK\\'s Foreign Office \\n is to monitor local media if you\\'re in or near affected areas. It warns\\n \"poor air quality can occur some distance from the sites of the fires \\nand provoke respiratory conditions\" and advises remaining across local \\nofficial advice. The US is giving similar advice.    If you no \\nlonger want to travel Australia, the first step is to contact the \\ncompany or agent you booked through to seek their advice. At the moment,\\n UK tour companies are not obliged to offer a refund if you want to \\ncancel.   If you have travel insurance, contact your insurer to ask \\nwhat your options are. Many policies do not cover natural disasters. Of \\ncourse, many tourism sites will be very keen for visitors to start \\ncoming back and spending as soon as possible.    The\\n Australian Defence Force (ADF) became visibly involved in the operation\\n in late December, when ships and aircraft were sent to Victoria to help\\n firefighters tackling blazes in East Gippsland and  to evacuate people trapped in the coastal town of Mallacoota.      But the ADF has been involved in the firefighting effort in some capacity since early September.     Australia\\'s states and territories are responsible for their own disaster responses but, according to  Australia\\'s disaster response plan,  they can ask for federal help if they \"cannot reasonably cope with the needs of the situation\".   The ADF stresses it is not trained or equipped to be a firefighting force.   There\\'s a long way to go before this is over. Australia\\'s fire season usually continues until well into March.    Some\\n plants and forests have evolved to cope with or even - in the case of \\neucalyptus trees - thrive on fires. But the scale and intensity of these\\n fires has been unprecedented, so there is fear  even seeds deep in the \\nsoil may have been damaged.    \"Until the fires subside, the full extent of damage will remain unknown,\" says Dr Stuart Blanch, of WWF-Australia.   But many burned areas \"will take decades to recover and some species may have tipped over the brink of extinction\".    Dr\\n Blanch says some forests will never recover, while it will most likely \\nbe decades before some trees will be big enough to have the holes needed\\n for animals to live in.    \"Hence the damage from these fires could last at least two centuries,\" he says.   That\\'s a real concern now. Dairy Farmers Australia says about 70 farms have been hit. Thousands of cattle have been killed.  BBC News spoke to one farmer who said he might now just have to sell up.     The\\n Foundation for Rural Regeneration and Renewal, a not-for-profit agency \\nthat gives grants to help recover from fires, says for many communities \\n\"help will be needed for many years to come\".   How quickly farmland\\n recovers depends on the size and heat of the fire. Most crops would of \\ncourse be lost - though some growing underground may survive - so will \\nneed replanting.  But flames can burn the nitrogen out  of soil, meaning farmers will have to add nutrients, possibly for years.     Fruit and olive trees \\n may actually survive a fire, even if they\\'re severely damaged, but will\\n take a few years before they fully recover. And of course the costs for\\n farmers could be astronomical.    The Insurance Council of Australia says overall  A$700m (APS370m) in losses have been filed so far.

The country is scrambling \\n to halt the spread of 2019-nCoV, also known as the Wuhan virus. The \\ninfection originated in a seafood and meat market in Wuhan, a large city\\n in central China.   Three people in the city have died from the illness,  local health authorities said . The total number of infections in the country was 217 as of Monday,   according to Reuters .   The virus has also spread to the Chinese cities of Beijing and Shenzhen, as well as South Korea, Thailand, and Japan.   Not much is known about the Wuhan virus, apart its pneumonialike \\nsymptoms a like a fever and difficulty breathing- and identification as a\\n strain of coronavirus infecting the nose, throat, or sinuses.

Follow Business Insider Australia on  Facebook ,  Twitter ,  LinkedIn , and  Instagram .   ', ' SYDNEY,\\n Australia a In late October, lightning struck brittle earth on Gospers \\nMountain in New South Wales. The remains of trees bone dry from \\nconsecutive winters with little to no rain were ignited, and the fire \\nquickly spread.   Three months later, it is still burning.   The\\n Gospers Mountain fire, which became Australiaas largest amegablazea as \\nit grew to link several separate fires, offers a sense of the scale of \\nthe countryas most disastrous fire season ever. The blaze has burned two\\n million acres, enveloping hinterland and wine country, and prompted a \\nspecial mission to save  prehistoric trees  so rare that their exact location is kept secret.   That\\n fire is now largely contained. But dozens of others are still burning \\nin the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, some out of \\ncontrol, despite heavy rain in some areas in recent days. And fire \\nseason is far from over a hot and windy conditions are expected to \\nreturn this week, and a month of summer remains. Here is a look at the \\ndevastation.         The modern world has never seen anything quite like these Australia fires.    About 16 million acres have burned \\n in New South Wales and Victoria, where the crisis is centered. Thatas \\nan area about the size of West Virginia. Millions more acres have burned\\n in other parts of the country.   What sets these blazes apart, in \\nterms of their size, is that they are happening in populated areas. \\nUntil now, fires this large happened mostly in places like northern \\nCanada or  Siberia , where few people live and blazes burn largely uncontrolled.   aWhat\\n weare seeing in Australia, in a completely different environment, are \\nfires that are approaching or even exceeding the magnitude of things \\nthat we only saw in the most remote forested regions in the world,a said\\n Ross Bradstock, the director of the Center for Environmental Risk \\nManagement of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong in New South \\nWales.   aWeare looking at a globally significant fire season in Australia,a he added.   The numbers from Australia dwarf those from some of the most high-profile fires in recent years.   The\\n bushfires in southeastern Australia this season have burned about eight\\n times as much land as the 2018 fires in California, which covered \\nnearly two million acres and were the worst in that stateas recorded \\nhistory. They are also far larger than the  estimates of 2.2 million acres \\n burned by September last year in the Amazon basin, where farmers, some \\nemboldened by the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, \\nignited tens of thousands of fires to clear land.   aItas\\n quite phenomenal and far exceeds anything you would see in the western \\nU.S.A., which is a very fire-prone area, the southwest of Canada, the \\nMediterranean and parts of South America,a Dr. Bradstock said. aItas so \\nmuch bigger than anything else.a   Australia\\n has had deadlier fire seasons: The Black Saturday bushfires, which \\nbegan in February 2009 when downed power lines ignited blazes that were \\nspread by 60-mile-per-hour winds, killed 173 people in Victoria. The \\n2018 California fires killed 103 people.   But the losses Australia \\nis experiencing in lives and property are still staggering, and not yet \\nover. At least 29 people have been killed. Hundreds of millions of \\nanimals, by some estimates, have perished or are facing starvation or \\ndehydration in devastated habitats. And more than 2,500 homes have been \\ndestroyed.   Smoke generated by the fires has blanketed Sydney, \\nMelbourne and Canberra, at times giving them some of the worst air in \\nthe world. The prolonged exposure of bushfire smoke to millions of \\npeople has raised  fears of health effects  that could last for years.   Early\\n this month, NASA began tracking a plume of smoke from the fires that \\nwas the size of the continental United States. By Jan. 14, smoke  had circumnavigated the globe ,\\n returning to eastern Australia. Along the way, it caused hazardous \\nbreathing conditions in New Zealand and discolored skies in South \\nAmerica.   The fires have also produced  huge amounts of heat-trapping carbon emissions .\\n A top expert on greenhouse gas emissions at Australiaas national \\nresearch agency told NPR that the fires in southeastern Australia had \\nproduced as much carbon as the entire country emits from man-made \\nsources in more than eight months of the year.         Why\\n have these fires been so vast? While Australia is normally hot and dry \\nin the summer, climate change is bringing longer and more frequent \\nperiods of extreme heat. That makes vegetation drier and more likely to \\nburn.   Last year was the hottest and driest year on record in \\nAustralia, and some regions have been gripped by drought for years. This\\n season, the fires started earlier than usual a some as soon as July a \\nand they are expected to last well into February and even March.   High\\n temperatures, strong winds and dry forests have combined to create the \\nconditions for powerful fires. There have even been blazes in wetlands \\nand rainforests that have not contended with this threat before. To \\ncombat the flames,  tens of thousands of firefighters, most of them volunteers , have been called on to work long days over extended periods.   Most of the fires have been caused by lightning strikes, though some people have  misleadingly pointed to arson \\n in an effort to minimize the links to climate change and the Australian\\n governmentas inaction on the issue. Others have argued that the drought\\n is unrelated to climate change, though there is evidence that warming \\ntemperatures have been a major contributor to it, in part by pushing \\nrain out of areas where it once fell.   aThe wildfires decimating \\nAustralia, killing people, ravaging wild habitats and pushing \\ncommunities and firefighters to their absolute limits are growing and \\ncoalescing into the countryas worst peacetime catastrophe precisely \\nbecause of climate change,a said Paul Read, a co-director of the \\nNational Center for Research in Bushfire and Arson at Monash University \\nin Melbourne.   In Australiaas history, most bad fire seasons have coincided with the warming of an El NiA+-o pattern. But  that is not the case this time ,\\n showing how much this season stands out and the danger the country \\nfaces with more unpredictable weather patterns in the future.   While\\n scientists have long predicted that climate change would bring longer \\nand more intense fire seasons, the blazes were not expected to be this \\nbad this soon, Dr. Bradstock said. Under his projections, Australia \\nwould not have seen this kind of devastation for another 40 to 50 years,\\n he said.   aI guess Iam as shocked as anyone about whatas unfolding\\n and, probably, like everyone else whoas involved and affected, weall \\nvery quickly recalibrate thinking about what weare doing,a he said.   Recalibrating\\n means expecting these phenomenal fires to continue to occur, \\nparticularly as Australiaas drought shows few signs of ending and \\ntemperatures are expected to continue to climb after the warmest decade \\non record.   aWe would be extremely foolish, given all the evidence \\nand the magnitude of this event, to just laugh it off as a one-off \\nphenomenon,a Dr. Bradstock said. aI think we have to get ready to deal \\nwith a season like this again in the not-too-distant future.a  ', \"    Published:    14:56 AEDT, 22 January 2020     |    Updated:    19:03 AEDT, 22 January 2020        A\\n drug used to treat anxiety can slow the spread of cancer by blocking \\nstress, according to a study by an Australian university.\\xa0   Beta-blockers,\\n a common pill taken to reduce blood pressure, could lead to a reduction\\n in the number deaths from breast cancer by stopping cancer cells from \\nspreading through the body.

The delegation attended the 4th International Rain Enhancement Forum, organised by the  UAE  Research Programme for Rain Enhancement Science under the NCMas supervision  from  19th-21st  January   2020 .    The delegation was received by Dr. Abdulla Al Mandous, Director of NCM and President of the Regional Association II ( Asia ) of the  World  Meteorological Organisation, WMO, along with senior officials  from  the centre.    The group comprised Dr. Nawal Al-Hosany, Permanent Representative of the  UAE  to IRENA; Dr. Deon Terblanche,  Weather  and Climate  consultant  at  World Bank \\n and former Director of Research at the WMO; Prof. Roelof Bruintjes, a \\nsenior scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research; Dr. \\nSteve Griffiths, Senior Vice President for Research and Development at \\nKhalifa University, and Dr. Lulin Xue, UAEREPas third cycle awardee, \\nChief Scientist at Hua Xin Chuang Zhi Science and  Technology  LLC and a member of the  Beijing   Weather  Modification Office advisory panel.    It\\n also included Richard Behnke, President at SciencePrime; Dr. Robert \\nRobinson, Chief Scientist at SciencePrime; Prof. Taha Ourada, Professor \\nand Chairman,  Canada  Research Chair in Statistical Hydro-Climatology at National Institute of Scientific Research; Prof. Steve Siems, Professor at  school  of Earth Atmosphere and Environment, Monash University; Dr.     Gary  Thunen, Chief Scientist and Senior Fellow, Advanced  Technology \\n Centre, Lockheed Martin Space; Dr. Mukul Tewari, Research Staff Member \\nat IBM, and Dr. Campbell Watson, Research Staff Member at IBM Research.    During the  visit , the delegation learned about the objectives of the-state-of-the-art facility that specialises in the manufacturing of various  weather  modification products in the  UAE , and its plans to conduct innovative research projects in  weather  modification and rain enhancement.    The\\n factory has developed several samples of specially-designed dispensers \\nto carry innovative nanomaterials as part of one of the programmeas \\nfirst cycle awardee project. Developed in collaboration with the \\nResearch, Development and Training department at the NCM, these \\nmaterials will be sprayed into clouds without altering their physical \\nand chemical characteristics using the centreas custom-designed \\naircraft.    The materials have a high condensation capability at \\nrelatively low levels of humidity compared to other materials, and their\\n design prevents the clotting of the materials during the process. The \\ndispensers underwent a series of ground field tests at a specially \\ndesigned facility within the Emirates  Weather  Enhancement Factory before being loaded into the aircraft, to determine the most suitable designs.    Nanomaterials can accelerate  water  condensation and droplet formation inside the clouds. This  results  in larger sizes of  water  droplets during rainfall, amounting to up to triple times the old method as proven by laboratory experiments and cloud  chamber  tests to simulate cloud development.

The\\n Kallaroo Road and Redwood Forest fires in the northern suburb of \\nPiallago merged to create the Beard fire, spanning 424 hectares on \\nThursday afternoon.   The fire is burning within containment lines and has been downgraded from an emergency warning to watch and act level.

ACT Fire and Rescue Chief Officer Mark Brown said \\nfirefighters and water-bombing helicopters would continue to work on the\\n fire into the evening.   \"It\\'s burning well within containment \\nlines and we have a large number of crews actively patrolling that \\nfire,\" he told reporters.   A fire is burning at a recycling centre\\n in Beard which earlier produced dangerous levels of thick, black smoke \\nwhich will reduced visibility and air quality.   Mr Brown said the situation had improved at the recycling plant.   \"The smoke plume has reduced significantly and firefighters will continue to work on that fire for the next few days,\" he said.   People in Beard, Harman, Oaks Estate and Crestwood are being told to stay inside to avoid the dangerous smoke.   People in Pialligo and Brindabella Business Park, near the airport, have been advised to stay up to date and monitor conditions.   There are unconfirmed reports of building damage, the ACT Emergency Services Agency said.   The\\n ESA\\'s website was down for much of the afternoon because the service \\nprovider had an outage affecting sites across southeast Australia.   Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the issues leading to the website failure would be reviewed after the fires.   \"Undoubtedly, we would want greater reliability for such an essential communication tool,\" he said.   ACT\\n Rural Fire Service chief officer Joe Murphy said predicted cooler, \\ncalmer condition on Friday would help crews control the fire.   \"The winds are abating and will be much lower tomorrow,\" he said.   Friday will not be a total fire ban.   Earlier, the ESA reported a firefighter had suffered minor injuries before being treated and continuing to fight the fire.   The blaze started on Wednesday but strong winds and high temperatures saw conditions in Canberra deteriorate.   Canberra\\'s state of alert will continue through to the end of the Australia Day long weekend.   \"We\\n look forward to conditions easing somewhat, but clearly we will remain \\non alert through the next 24 hours and over the long weekend,\" Mr Barr \\nsaid.

And everyone will \\nexperience it differently. Here\\'s what to expect if it\\'s your first time\\n giving birth.\\xa0   The first stage of labor is when you start feeling regular contractions until you are 10 cm dilated. It can last anywhere from  a couple of hours to a few days.  But it\\'s the second stage of labor when you can expect the most pain.   The second stage of labor encompasses that time that your spending pushing at 10 cm until the baby is delivered. The  pain  may intensify as contractions increase in frequency and the baby starts to crown.\\xa0   According to  Euan Wallace ,\\n the former director of obstetrics services at Monash Health in \\nAustralia, the second stage is where severe cramping or a gripping \\nsensation in the abdomen may come in. Wallace says many women complain \\nof back pain during the second stage, which could indicate the way the \\nbaby is positioned a babies facing up tend to cause  more severe back pain. \\xa0   On\\n a scale of one to ten, Wallace says some women describe labor pain as a\\n minimum two or three, while others feel it as a ten. The pain from \\ncontractions comes and goes with brief periods of relief.\\xa0    The mother\\'s position during labor \\n also matters. Squatting may reduce labor pain and shorten the second \\nstage of labor. Sitting positions are associated with less labor pain \\nand shortened second stage of labor, but increased blood loss and \\nobstetric anal sphincter injury.\\xa0   The  second stage of labor  is the most physically active for your body. According to a  2011 study ,\\n your heart rate can go up to nearly 200 beats per minute. \"[It\\'s] \\neasily equivalent to an elite athlete\\'s most intense workout,\" Wallace \\nsays.\\xa0   Once you\\'re done giving birth, the pain should subside but expect to be sore, particularly in the  back, stomach, and pelvic muscles . Lacerations and incision sites could also hurt, such as vaginal lacerations tears or  episiotomy ,\\n which is an incision made on the vaginal opening to widen it and help \\nthe baby get out.

Australian researchers developed the material out \\nof indium tin oxide and used a liquid metal printing technique to turn \\nit into a two-dimensional film.   The touch-responsive material is \\n100 times thinner than existing touchscreen materials used in \\nsmartphones and tablets and is so pliable that it can be rolled up like a\\n tube.   Smartphone makers like Samsung and Motorola have recently \\nreleased their own curvy displays that can bend without breaking, but \\nthe RMIT team says its version even twists.   The team has developed\\n a working prototype touchscreen from the material and has applied for a\\n patent to commercialise the technology.   A sample of the \\nultra-thin and ultra-flexible electronic material that could be printed \\nand rolled out like newspaper, for the touchscreens of the future   'We've\\n taken an old material and transformed it from the inside to create a \\nnew version that's supremely thin and flexible,' said lead researcher Dr\\n Torben Daeneke, at RMIT in Melbourne, Australia.   'You can bend \\nit, you can twist it, and you could make it far more cheaply and \\nefficiently that the slow and expensive way that we currently \\nmanufacture touchscreens.'   The nano-thin sheets are highly conductive and two dimensional a with a thickness of about 1.4 nanometres.   This equates to about 10 to 15 atoms, or about a billionth of a metre.\\xa0   'Turning it two-dimensional also makes it more transparent, so it lets through more light,' said Dr Daeneke.   To\\n create the new conductive sheet, an RMIT University-led team used a \\nthin film common in cell phone touchscreens and shrunk it from 3D to 2D,\\n using 'liquid metal chemistry'   'This means a cell phone \\nwith a touchscreen made of our material would use less power, extending \\nthe battery life by roughly 10 per cent.'   The current methods of \\nmanufacturing transparent films for standard touchscreens is a slow, \\nenergy-intensive and expensive process, conducted in a vacuum chamber to\\n remove the surrounding air.   'The beauty is that our approach \\ndoesn't require expensive or specialised equipment a it could even be \\ndone in a home kitchen,' Dr Daeneke said.\\xa0   The nano-thin \\nsheet is readily compatible with existing electronic technologies and, \\nbecause of its high flexibility, could be manufactured through \\nroll-to-roll (R2R) processing much like newspaper.\\xa0   The\\n research team that created the new material, from left to right, Dr \\nRobi Datta, Dr Torben Daeneke and Dr Nitu Syed at RMIT, Melbourne, \\nAustralia   Indium tin oxide (ITO),\\xa0a colourless 'ternary' compound, is itself made out of three compounds a indium, tin and oxygen.   It has a high eclectic conductivity and transparency in a range of colours.\\xa0   Most smartphone touchscreens are made of ITO, which is very conductive but also, in its 3D form, rather brittle. \\xa0   To\\n create the new type of atomically thin ITO, the researchers started by \\nheating an indium-tin alloy to 392AdegF (200AdegC) at which point it becomes \\nliquid ITO.\\xa0   This was then rolled over a surface to print off nano-thin sheets of indium tin oxide.   These\\n 2D sheets have the same chemical make-up as standard ITO but a \\ndifferent crystal structure, giving them new mechanical and optical \\nproperties.   The new ITO absorbs just 0.7 per cent of light compared to the 5 to 10 per cent of standard conductive glass.\\xa0   This\\n means more than 99 per cent would be reflected back at the smartphone \\nuser's line of vision for a clearer, crisper display.\\xa0   'There's\\n no other way of making this fully flexible, conductive and transparent \\nmaterial aside from our new liquid metal method,' said Dr Daeneke.   'It was impossible up to now a people just assumed that it couldn't be done.'   The\\n material could also be used in many other opto-electronic applications,\\n such as LEDs and other touch displays, as well as cells for \\nsolar-powered devices and smart windows.   'We're excited to be at \\nthe stage now where we can explore commercial collaboration \\nopportunities and work with the relevant industries to bring this \\ntechnology to market,' Daeneke said.

The phone was beleaguered by technical hitches in the run-up to its worldwide launch, however.

Prime\\n Minister Morrison said the confirmation of a case in Australia had been\\n anticipated and procedures are in place to manage the situation.   'I'd\\n urge Australians to go about their day, go about their business in the \\nknowledge that the professionals and the experts are there to provide \\nthe support that is needed in times like this are on the job and they're\\n getting about it to keep you and your families safe,' he said.

There is said to be little risk\\n of him spreading the deadly virus in Melbourne, as he spent the last \\nweek with family and hasn't visited any public places since being in \\nAustralia.   'He stayed in his room as he was conscious he may have \\ncaught the disease, so his family didn't allow anyone in his room,' Dr \\nBone said.\\xa0   Medical staff work in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Wuhan (pictured) have been working round the clock   'He\\n has not been out and about, so I guess that minimises the risk to the \\nbroader community and he has taken all the appropriate precautions in \\nterms of calling ahead to the GP clinic and to the hospital before he \\nhas presented on both of those occasions.

France\\n has confirmed two coronavirus cases, the first in Europe. Despite \\nprevention measures such as sanitation being done in South Korea \\n(pictured), the virus continues to spread globally   'There's \\nno evidence of human to human transmission here [in Australia].\\xa0It \\nwill be very hard to be specific about where people catch it from,' she \\nsaid.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   Transportation in Wuhan, the \\nepicentre of the outbreak, and at least 12 nearby cities has been shut \\ndown, effectively placing 36 million people into lockdown.   So far \\nmore than 1320 people have been infected in China while France has had \\nthree people test positive - the disease's first appearance in Europe.   Two cases, including a Chicago woman returning from China, have been confirmed in the United States.\\xa0    What is this virus?    The\\n virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses \\nare a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory \\ninfections such as the common cold.   But coronaviruses can also be \\ndeadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a \\ncoronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the \\nearly 2000s.    Can it kill?    Yes. 41 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus.\\xa0    What are the symptoms?    Its\\n symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some \\npatients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening \\ninfection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. \\nPeople carrying the novel coronavirus may only have mild symptoms, such \\nas a sore throat. They may assume they have a common cold and not seek \\nmedical attention, experts fear.    How is it detected?    The\\n virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to the \\nrest of the world to enable other countries to quickly diagnose \\npotential new cases. This helps other countries respond quickly to \\ndisease outbreaks.   To contain the virus, airports are detecting \\ninfected people with temperature checks. But as with every virus, it has\\n an incubation period, meaning detection is not always possible because \\nsymptoms have not appeared yet.    How did it start and spread?    The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.   Cases have since been identified elsewhere which could have been spread through human-to-human transmission.    What are countries doing to prevent the spread?    Countries\\n in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South\\n Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.   Australia\\n and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the \\nUK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan.   Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before?   Experts\\n have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory \\nsyndrome (SARS). The epidemic started in southern China and killed more \\nthan 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere \\xa0   \", \"    Published:    20:51 AEDT, 25 January 2020     |    Updated:    21:37 AEDT, 25 January 2020        Former bikie: Moudi Tajjour   An\\n Instagram-famous bikie and convicted killer has claimed the Wuhan \\ncoronavirus sweeping across the world is 'Allah's revenge' for  China 's persecution of millions of Muslims.

The\\n virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses \\nare a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory \\ninfections such as the common cold.   But coronaviruses can also be \\ndeadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a \\ncoronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the \\nearly 2000s.    Can it kill?    Yes. 42 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus.\\xa0    What are the symptoms?    Its\\n symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some \\npatients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening \\ninfection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. \\nPeople carrying the novel coronavirus may only have mild symptoms, such \\nas a sore throat. They may assume they have a common cold and not seek \\nmedical attention, experts fear.    How is it detected?    The\\n virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to the \\nrest of the world to enable other countries to quickly diagnose \\npotential new cases. This helps other countries respond quickly to \\ndisease outbreaks.   To contain the virus, airports are detecting \\ninfected people with temperature checks. But as with every virus, it has\\n an incubation period, meaning detection is not always possible because \\nsymptoms have not appeared yet.    How did it start and spread?    The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.   Cases have since been identified elsewhere which could have been spread through human-to-human transmission.    What are countries doing to prevent the spread?    Countries\\n in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South\\n Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.   Australia\\n and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the \\nUK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan.   Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before?   Experts\\n have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory \\nsyndrome (SARS). The epidemic started in southern China and killed more \\nthan 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere \\xa0   \", \" Facemasks\\n have sold out at a Chemist Warehouse branch as Australians fear a \\npotential outbreak of the disease which has killed 56 people and \\ninfected almost 2,000.

Health\\n officials are meanwhile trying to track down hundreds of passengers who\\n shared flight with a man in Australia diagnosed with the virus.   The\\n man arrived in Sydney from Wuhan, the Chinese city which is at the \\nepicentre of the escalating outbreak, on January 20.\\xa0   The \\n53-year-old arrived in Sydney on China Eastern Flight MU749, landing at \\n11.35am, and developed symptoms that night before seeing a doctor.   NSW Health is trying to find his fellow passengers to see if they could have been infected by coming into contact with him.   The deadly virus has already claimed 56 lives in China and is expected to rise worldwide\\xa0   'We\\n have asked the National Incident Room to pull the records for those \\npeople that were on the flight and we are getting the seat details,' NSW\\n chief medical officer Kerry Chant said.\\xa0   Three men in NSW, aged 43, 53 and 35, and one aged in his 50s in Victoria have caught the deadly disease.   None of the men are in a serious condition. They are in hospital simply to stop the virus spreading.\\xa0   Two flew from Wuhan while the other arrived in Sydney from Shenzhen in southern China, just north of Hong Kong.   None of the men had symptoms on the flight so the likelihood that they infected fellow passengers is low.

However,\\n they may have come into contact with hundreds of people since getting \\noff their planes and despite interviewing many people who met them, \\nthere would be many others at risk.   Officials urged anyone with symptoms who has been to China recently to come forward.   Dr Chant also asked GPs to contact NSW Health if they had a patient showing symptoms of\\xa0coronavirus.   'Make\\n sure you have processes in place and consider where people have \\ntravelled and particularly be conscious of people returning from China,'\\n she said.\\xa0   NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said anyone who comes forward with symptoms will have their privacy respected.   'They should also call ahead to speak to their GP or emergency department,' he said.   'If the GP considers novel coronavirus testing is needed they will be referred to the emergency department for testing.'\\xa0   The patient in Victoria is a\\xa0Chinese national aged in his 50s who flew to Melbourne\\xa0 on China Southern flight CZ321 from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on an\\xa0A380 plane, which can can carry 500 passengers.

Officials\\n expect more people will be struck down with the dangerous virus in \\ncoming weeks as it threatens to become a global pandemic.\\xa0\\xa0   Prime\\n Minister Scott Morrison said\\xa0the federal government has stepped up\\n measures to protect Australians from the virus, along with giving a \\ndire warning to not travel to China's Wuhan or Hubei provinces.\\xa0   'From\\n today (Saturday), anyone arriving in Australia on flights from other \\nparts of China will be met and provided instruction on what to do it \\nthey have symptoms it start to develop them,' he said.\\xa0   'Chinese authorities have also imposed travel restriction sin at least five cities in the Hubei province.   'Australians travelling to these areas may not be able to leave until restrictions are lifted.   Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms.   If and when they do, typical signs include:   The\\n vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available \\ndata a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.   In\\n a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those \\nwith long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia.\\xa0   Pneumonia\\n is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill \\nwith fluid.

China's\\n status as a major superpower may have influenced the World Health \\nOrganisation's decision not to declare coronavirus an international \\nemergency, experts have warned.\\xa0   More than 1,300 people have \\nbeen infected globally with the virus traced to a seafood market in the \\ncentral city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.   Despite\\n this, the WHO has failed to declare a global health crisis. On Thursday\\n the organisation said it was 'too early' for such a decision but added \\nan emergency could still be declared if the outbreak continues to \\nspread.\\xa0   'This should not be taken as a sign that we don't \\nthink the outbreak is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously,' \\nsaid WHO Director-General\\xa0Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\\xa0   'Nothing could be further from the truth.'\\xa0   Now, baffled experts have warned that their decision may have been influenced by China.\\xa0   Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told  The Daily Telegraph :\\xa0'The criteria for declaring a public health emergency of international concern have been met.'   \\xa0But 'not all WHO decisions are made based on the developments in the biological world,' he added.   The\\n Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade overnight raised the level of \\ntravel advice for Wuhan and Hubei province to 'do not travel'.\\xa0   The disease is listed as having 'pandemic potential', allowing border measures to be enhanced.   'The\\n confirmation today by Victorian authorities of the coronavirus case was\\n a matter that had been anticipated,' Mr Morrison said.\\xa0   'The Australian government is of course taking this issue incredibly seriously.'\\xa0   About a dozen cases are being investigated nationwide, according to Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young.   'It's an evolving number,' she told reporters on Saturday.   'We\\n will be treating them as if they're confirmed cases, as a precaution. \\nWe still don't understand the transmissibility of this virus.   'If \\nyou develop fever, coughs or shortness of breath, you should ring ahead \\nto your GP, discuss it and your GP will refer you to the emergency \\ndepartment.'   Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said\\n it was important for people arriving from Wuhan - and those in close \\ncontact with them - to monitor for symptoms including fever, cough, sore\\n throat, vomiting and difficulty breathing.   'We don't know exactly\\n how long symptoms take to show after a person has been infected but \\nthere is an incubation period and some patients will have very mild \\nsymptoms,' Prof Murphy said.\\xa0\\xa0   56 lives have been lost to the virus in China, and\\xa01,975 people have been infected nationally.\\xa0   'We're\\n confident that outside the major epicentre of China there is not yet \\nevidence of significant, or any, human to human spread,' Prof Murphy \\nsaid.   A pamphlet handed out by the Australian Government providing travellers with information on the deadly coronavirus (pictured)   Federal and state chief medical officers held joint discussions on Saturday with health ministers expected to do the same.   Prime\\n Minister Morrison said the confirmation of a case in Australia had been\\n anticipated and procedures are in place to manage the situation.   'I'd\\n urge Australians to go about their day, go about their business in the \\nknowledge that the professionals and the experts are there to provide \\nthe support that is needed in times like this are on the job and they're\\n getting about it to keep you and your families safe,' he said.   The\\n infected man in Melbourne has pneumonia and is in a stable condition, \\nbeing treated in a negative pressure isolation room.\\xa0   Deputy \\nChief Health Officer Dr Angie Bone said the man felt tired after landing\\n in Melbourne, before he started feeling ill later that day.   He then presented himself to a doctor on Thursday, four days after arriving in Australia.   'My\\n understanding is he came off the plane and felt very tired and spent \\nthe next day resting in his room, towards the end of the day he \\ndeveloped symptoms,' Dr Bone said.   Patients with the novel \\ncoronavirus (pictured) typically have a fever, cough and trouble \\nbreathing, but some patients have developed pneumonia   There \\nis said to be little risk of him spreading the deadly virus in \\nMelbourne, as he spent the last week with family and hasn't visited any \\npublic places since being in Australia.   'He stayed in his room as \\nhe was conscious he may have caught the disease, so his family didn't \\nallow anyone in his room,' Dr Bone said.\\xa0   'He has not been \\nout and about, so I guess that minimises the risk to the broader \\ncommunity and he has taken all the appropriate precautions in terms of \\ncalling ahead to the GP clinic and to the hospital before he has \\npresented on both of those occasions.   'So, he has done everything right. The family has done everything right to minimise the risk.   'There\\n is a possibility the family may have caught the infection, we will be \\nobserving them very closely. It will help us understand how easy it is \\nto transmit this virus.'\\xa0   Dr Bone said the man wasn't a health care worker and may well have picked up the disease in a public setting.

Public Health services identified the \\nman's contacts since returning to Hobart in case he had been identified \\nas carrying the virus.   The man has been discharged from hospital after his results showed he was not infected.\\xa0     What is the Chinese coronavirus?     The\\n virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses \\nare a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory \\ninfections such as the common cold.   But coronaviruses can also be \\ndeadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a \\ncoronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the \\nearly 2000s.    Can it kill?    Yes. 56 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus.\\xa0    What are the symptoms?    Its\\n symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some \\npatients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening \\ninfection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. \\nPeople carrying the novel coronavirus may only have mild symptoms, such \\nas a sore throat. They may assume they have a common cold and not seek \\nmedical attention, experts fear.    How is it detected?    The\\n virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to the \\nrest of the world to enable other countries to quickly diagnose \\npotential new cases. This helps other countries respond quickly to \\ndisease outbreaks.   To contain the virus, airports are detecting \\ninfected people with temperature checks. But as with every virus, it has\\n an incubation period, meaning detection is not always possible because \\nsymptoms have not appeared yet.    How did it start and spread?    The first cases identified were among people connected to the  Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan .   Cases have since been identified elsewhere which could have been spread through human-to-human transmission.    What are countries doing to prevent the spread?    Countries in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include  Japan ,  South Korea ,  Thailand , Hong Kong,  Indonesia ,  Malaysia  and Philippines.    Australia  and the  US are also screening  patients for a high temperature, and the UK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan.   Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before?   Experts have  compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) . The epidemic started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere \\xa0   \", \" The\\n Matildas have been caught up in the coronavirus crisis with the \\nAustralian soccer team having to move their Olympic qualifying matches \\naway from  China .\\xa0   Sydney will now host the Matildas' matches against China, Taiwan and  Thailand  after the\\xa0Asian Football Confederation elected to move the games away from Nanjing due to the outbreak of the coronavirus.

If and when they do, typical signs include:   The\\n vast majority of patients a at least 97 per cent, based on available \\ndata a will recover from these without any issues or medical help.

He\\n contacted a general practitioner with respiratory problems and was \\nadmitted into an isolation room in hospital while tests were conducted \\nto rule out the infection.   Public Health services identified the \\nman's contacts since returning to Hobart in case he had been identified \\nas carrying the virus.   The man has been discharged from hospital after his results showed he was not infected.\\xa0    What is this virus?    The\\n virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses \\nare a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory \\ninfections such as the common cold.   But coronaviruses can also be \\ndeadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a \\ncoronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the \\nearly 2000s.    Can it kill?    Yes. 80 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus.\\xa0    What are the symptoms?    Its\\n symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some \\npatients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening \\ninfection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. \\nPeople carrying the novel coronavirus may only have mild symptoms, such \\nas a sore throat. They may assume they have a common cold and not seek \\nmedical attention, experts fear.    How is it detected?    The\\n virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to the \\nrest of the world to enable other countries to quickly diagnose \\npotential new cases. This helps other countries respond quickly to \\ndisease outbreaks.   To contain the virus, airports are detecting \\ninfected people with temperature checks. But as with every virus, it has\\n an incubation period, meaning detection is not always possible because \\nsymptoms have not appeared yet.    How did it start and spread?    The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.   Cases have since been identified elsewhere which could have been spread through human-to-human transmission.    What are countries doing to prevent the spread?    Countries\\n in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South\\n Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.   Australia\\n and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the \\nUK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan.   Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before?   Experts\\n have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory \\nsyndrome (SARS). The epidemic started in southern China and killed more \\nthan 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere \\xa0   \", \" An Australian-style points-based  immigration  system would allow Britain to control the number of people coming into the country after  Brexit  but still welcome much needed professionals such as nurses, according to the Government.   The Press Association\\xa0asked Dr Alan Gamlen, an associate \\nprofessor leading the human geography programme at Monash University in \\nMelbourne\\xa0and researcher at the University of Oxford's Centre on \\nMigration, Policy and Society,\\xa0how such a system could work.   Australia has what is known as a general skilled migration \\nprogramme, where immigrants applying for a visa are typically selected \\nbased on aeconomically relevant characteristicsa such as education, \\nlanguage skills and work experience. This does not apply for refugees \\nand asylum seekers and there are other visas available with different \\nrequirements, like travel or holiday visas.   The exact way points are allocated changes depending on policy \\nand the labour market but typically an applicant picks a askilled \\noccupationa from a list and needs to score a minimum number of points. \\nThe visa application is submitted online after a series of checks and \\nrequires personal, financial and contact details, identity documents, as\\n well as education, employment, health and travel history.   At present, an Australian visa for a askilled independent migranta needs 65 points.   Characteristics attracting the highest points include:   Fees vary depending on the  visa \\n but a skilled independent visa costs the equivalent of about APS2,169 \\n(A$4,045). Most visas are processed within 18 months and allow \\napplicants to permanently work and study anywhere in Australia, as well \\nas sponsor eligible relatives for permanent residence and, if eligible, \\neventually obtain Australian citizenship.   The points-based system used by Australia, Canada and New Zealand\\n all areplaced colonial-era systems that explicitly discriminated \\nbetween applicants based on race and ethnicitya, \\nDr\\xa0Gamlen\\xa0said. This system is considered fairer, more \\nobjective, and by capping the number of certain visas is thought to \\nallow a country to choose what it considers to be athe besta immigrants \\nand address staff shortages. But critics complain the approach presents a\\n a narrow view \\n of what constitutes a valuable contribution to a societya, \\nDr\\xa0Gamlen\\xa0added, warning it could lead to abrain wastea, with \\nsurgeons ending up driving taxis, for example, if there are not enough \\npositions to fill.   It would involve asome major changes to the UK's current  migration-management \\n systemsa which Dr\\xa0Gamlen\\xa0said have evolved in a amuch more ad\\n hoc fashiona than some other countries. aIt would be difficult if not \\nimpossible to identify and transfer an Australian model to the UK \\ncontext and achieve comparable outcomes,a he said. Australia's system \\ninvolves long-term data collection, research and consultation. The \\nsystem there has developed over decades and continues to change aso \\ncannot be simply transplanted to the UKa, he added.   Introducing such a system awould likely involve trial and error over a significant period of time for the UK  immigration system \\n to develop into something more like the Australian systema, \\nDr\\xa0Gamlen\\xa0said. He warned that it may not solve amigration \\nmanagement issues, nor will it be a simple plug-and-play procedurea.    Press Association   \", '   Jan 28, 2020          Close    Evonne\\n Goolagong Cawley, the Australian tennis champion who won seven major \\ntitles between 1971 and 1980, was retired and living well outside the \\ntennis bubble when  Roger Federer  hit his stride. Even she could not help but notice.   Watching\\n him play, Goolagong was struck by his skills. They seemed to be old \\nschool with a contemporary twist. Celebrated in her prime for her \\nballetic movement and liquid, single-handed backhand, Goolagong felt an \\nimmediate affinity with Federer.   \"I thought, \\'Wow,\\' here was \\nsomeone with all the skills of his hero, Rod Laver,\" Goolagong told \\nESPN.com in a recent interview. \"He was magical to watch. Every time he \\nturned his shoulder and then hit that one-handed backhand, it took me \\nback. I thought, \\'Oh, that must have felt good!\\'\"   Goolagong, now \\n68, also found herself wondering if Australia would ever produce another\\n woman player who had a comparable skill set that  included a one-handed\\n backhand slice and great touch around the net, abetted by a \\ncommunicable passion for the game.   \"And now here we have  Ash [Barty] ,\" Goolagong said. \"She has all the old skills and values, and you can see that she just loves to play.\"   Barty,\\n the defending French Open champion, is currently in the hunt to become \\nthe first Australian of either gender to win the singles title at the \\nAustralian Open since Chris O\\'Neil won the women\\'s event in 1978. \\nGoolagong won the last of her four Australian Open titles in 1977, the \\nyear when she also won the French Open. She missed out on completing a \\ncareer Grand Slam by faltering at the US Open despite playing in four \\nfinals there.   Barty, now 23, has known Goolagong since she made \\nher Australian Open debut in 2012. \"I could tell she had it when I saw \\nher that day [in 2012],\" Goolagong said. \"She played this one point in \\nwhich she hit every shot. She lost that match but I knew then she would \\ndevelop into what she is now.\"   When Barty hit an emotional wall in\\n 2016 and quit the game for some 18 months, Goolagong was there for her.\\n According to Ashleigh\\'s father, Rob, the first text message his \\ndaughter received when the news of her hiatus broke was from Goolagong, \\nwho cheerily advised her, \"Good decision. Go and wet a line and catch a \\nfew fish.\"   Apparently, it was just what Barty needed to hear. It \\nwas also the kind of wisdom that helped endear Goolagong to scores of \\nfans and fellow players during a career that formally ended in 1983.   During\\n her playing days, Goolagong was carefree, blithe, seemingly oblivious \\nto the pressures and anxieties of her profession. Legend had it that her\\n name in a long-lost language meant, \"Tall trees by still water,\" \\nalthough an anthropologist later suggested the more accurate translation\\n might have been \"Nose of the kangaroo.\"   When Goolagong left the \\ntennis circus, she had no desire to return or even to follow it. She \\nyearned to explore her roots as an indigenous woman.   \"I had to \\nlearn about who I really [was],\" Goolagong said, \"That was important to \\nget me through the difficulty I had in adjusting to life after the \\ntour.\"   The Goolagongs were the only Aboriginal family in the small\\n town of Barellan in New South Wales. Her first racket, as she likes to \\ntell the indigenous children who attend the various camps and events run\\n by the Evonne Goolagong Foundation, was a board prised off an apple \\ncrate by her father, an itinerant sheep shearer, wheat grader and \\nshade-tree mechanic.   At age 8, Goolagong read a story in \\n\"Princess\" magazine about a young girl who trained in tennis and was \\nultimately transported to this magical-looking place called Wimbledon. \\n\"I didn\\'t know it [Wimbledon] existed,\" Goolagong said. \"Somebody told \\nme it was in England, London. So every time I hit the ball against the \\nwall I would pretend to be there.\"   The journey in real life took a\\n bit longer. Goolagong hit against any firm surface she could find, from\\n water tanks to walls of houses, first with the board, later with \\nhand-me-down rackets.   \"When I heard how Ash used to hit the ball \\nagainst the side of her house, it reminded me of me,\" Goolagong said. \"I\\n would try to see how many times I could hit the ball against the wall \\non one bounce before I missed. Every day I would write the number in the\\n dirt and return the next day to try to beat it.\"   Soon, the keen \\nyoung athlete caught the eye of Barellan\\'s townspeople. The first to \\nnotice her exceptional talent was a local man named Stan Smith (no \\nrelation to the American tennis champion). The Goolagongs\\' next-door \\nneighbors were the Dunlops. Her life was taking on the properties of a \\nsong by the Beatles.   \"Some of the farmers and the president of the\\n local tennis club drove me to small tournaments,\" Goolagong said. \"The \\ntownspeople took around a hat and collected funds for me to be able to \\ngo to Sydney for further training. They bought my suitcase, my clothes \\n... everything. We didn\\'t really have any money.\"   Currency, no, \\nbut those dreams were realized at a heavy price. In Sydney, Goolagong \\nbecame the protege of a well-known coach, Vic Edwards. She lived in his \\nhome as a member of the family. Edwards, a controlling, surrogate \\nfather, seemed a relic of the Victorian era. He also harbored demons \\nthat would assert themselves as time went on and Goolagong found \\nsuccess. By 1971, Goolagong, just 20, won the Australian and French \\nOpens. In 1974, Goolagong\\'s father, Kenny, was killed by a hit-and-run \\ndriver while crossing a road at dusk. He was just 44. Evonne spent the \\nnight under sedation at a hotel in Houston, a match against Chris Evert \\ncanceled and Edwards adamantly refusing to allow Goolagong to return \\nhome for her father\\'s funeral.   Nine months after the death of her \\nfather, on the eve of Wimbledon, Goolagong secretly married a former \\nBritish junior tennis player, Roger Cawley. The couple soon broke \\ncompletely from Edwards. Goolagong\\'s appetite for tennis returned and \\nshe flourished. She eventually became the only mother to have won the \\nWimbledon title since 1914, overcoming Evert in the final in 1980.   Aboriginal\\n elders helped Goolagong face the unresolved anger and guilt she felt \\nabout not standing up to Edwards when he forbade her to attend her \\nfather\\'s funeral. Goolagong went through \"women\\'s business,\" a \\nspiritual, somewhat secretive, ritual through which indigenous women \\nexplore their heritage. She became acquainted with tribal Ngangkari \\nhealers.   \"I would never have gotten where I was without support,\" \\nshe said. \"When we came back from America [the Cawleys lived in the \\nUnited States for many years], I told Roger, \\'I want to do for others \\nwhat the townspeople did for me.\\'\"   Goolagong\\n served in various roles as a consultant in indigenous sport for some \\nyears, culminating with the formation of her eponymous foundation that \\naided indigenous children in 2005. It would become the focus of the \\nCawleys\\' life together, and remains so today. While Barty was busy \\npushing her way to the Australian Open quarterfinals, the Cawleys were \\njust 12 miles away, but in many ways worlds apart, working at Monash \\nUniversity with indigenous children who earned places in the Evonne \\nGoolagong Foundation\\'s National Development Camp.   Between hitting \\nsessions and presentations by a host of experts on subjects as far \\nranging as nutrition and career planning, the children watched \\nAustralian Open tennis, especially when Barty was playing. \"Oh, they all\\n identify with Ash,\" Goolagong said. \"Even while the camp was going on \\nthey were finding ways to watch and cheer for her. She\\'s a wonderful \\nrole model for our kids.\"   Goolagong\\'s program is focused less on \\npure tennis development and more on providing campers with the tools to \\nbe successful in whatever they choose to pursue. \"Our goal is keeping \\nkids in schools and helping them achieve their dreams. It\\'s all about \\nhaving a healthy body and a healthy mind.\"   The program, Goolagong \\nsaid, has been a great hit. The retention rate in school (through Grade \\n12) has been nearly 100 percent. The foundation has locked down 71 \\nscholarships approved by the Institute of Quality Education, and 18 \\nalumni of the program are currently enrolled in colleges or \\nuniversities.   \"We just produced our first two doctors,\" Goolagong said. \"There will be more.\"   Goolagong\\'s\\n activities did not go unnoticed by the Bartys. Ash has said her own \\ninterest in her heritage was fueled when she was about 8, and her \\nfather, Rob, sat her two older sisters down to explain their roots. Rob,\\n a member of the Ngaragu tribe, worked for the government in indigenous \\naffairs in the Australian state of Queensland for decades. Fascinated \\nfrom the start, Ash embraced her heritage and eventually came to learn \\nabout Goolagong\\'s own aboriginal pride, and her work with indigenous \\nyouth.   \"When I first met Evonne, I was gobsmacked,\" Barty told The\\n Australian newspaper late in 2019, during a rare public appearance with\\n Goolagong at a clinic for indigenous children in Cairns. \"She is this \\nincredible lady who had a remarkable career. ... She has paved the way \\nfor so many people. When I was a bit older, I began to understand just \\nhow much of an impact she truly had and how much time and energy she has\\n invested into creating opportunities for all indigenous youth across \\nthe nation.\"   Goolagong has communicated with her friend on only \\none occasion in recent days, sending Barty a congratulatory text Friday \\nwhen she was named 2020\\'s \"Young Australian of the Year,\" and plans to \\nattend the women\\'s final if Barty advances.   \"Maybe one day it would be nice if we went out together and did women\\'s business,\" Goolagong said.   It could happen, but like Goolagong in an earlier era, Barty has some tennis business to take care of first.

The proximity of people to live and dead animals makes it easy for humans to contract viruses.   The SARS virus which broke out in 2003 also likely started in wet markets.

If something (more serious) happens it would be all over the news.   'We have friend in China - she's very worried about everything.'   Tuan's attitude was: 'Be sensible but not panicking too much.'   'Generally speaking, it should be fine,' he said.   'When we go to the public places where there's so many people you don't know whether they've travelled overseas.   'You can't tell that. That could be a problem.'   He and Tien would continue to avoid large crowds when possible and monitor news reports.   'I don't need to go out and hunt for the masks,' he said.   His wife felt the same way.

A\\n middle-aged woman shopping in Cabramatta with her son said the pair \\nwore masks whenever they were out in public, 'just to protect \\nourselves'.   In the face of bogus scare campaigns, printing \\nbusinessman Dong Yang said 'I don't think it's that serious ... there's \\nno need to wear the masks in Australia'   'We're just worried about the coronavirus,' she said. 'Just when we go out to places where there's a lot of people.'   No one wearing a mask took it off when asked why there were wearing one.   Dong\\n Yang, who runs a printing business, was not wearing a mask and said \\nmore people covered their faces in Cabramatta when bushfire smoke \\nenveloped Sydney.   'I don't think it's that serious,' the 62-year-old said of the coronavirus threat as he shopped with his wife.   'And also the authorities say maybe there's no need to wear the masks in Australia.   'We believe the authorities and what the government says. I think in Australia it's under good control.   'Everything should be okay. Actually we're not worried too much about it.'

'I don't wanna die at\\n uni': Fearful students refuse to go back to class after Chinese \\nclassmate, 21, was diagnosed with coronavirus while living on campus       By Nic White for Daily Mail Australia     Students at a Sydney university where a classmate was diagnosed with coronavirus say they are too afraid to go back to class.

Hundreds\\n on social media said they planned to skip classes, insist on doing \\ntheir courses online, or take the semester off entirely.   Others begged the university to postpone orientation week, which begins on February 10, and the start of classes a week later.   'Please cancel I don't wanna die at UNSW,' one student wrote.   'Well I guess I'm just going to defer this semester,' another wrote.   Some\\n students planned to still study, but called for them to be allowed to \\ntake their classes online to avoid campus during the coronavirus crisis.   'They\\n should have an online only option, don't wanna get sick,' one wrote, \\nwhile another said 'surely they are getting rid of all compulsory \\nclasses?'   Students at the University of NSW where a classmate was diagnosed with coronavirus say they are too afraid to go back to class   Emma Wei, from Melbourne, is trapped in\\xa0Wuhan with her two children amid China's lockdown   Parents and friends also expressed concern, some warning students against setting foot on the Randwick complex.   'I would be concerned about my child going to that uni, who else has been infected! This is the scary part!' one mother wrote.   Another added: 'Now I can start to worry again my grand daughter has stared her first day of classes.'   NSW\\n Health said the student was being treated in isolation at Westmead \\nHospital and only had limited contact with people in Australia - \\nreducing the likelihood that she had spread the virus.\\xa0\\xa0   'The\\n student did not attend any classes at the university and stayed on her \\nown in campus accommodation with no close contact before she was \\nadmitted to hospital,' UNSW said in an email to students.   Students\\n expressed frustration that the university did not specify which campus \\naccommodation the student was staying in and would not tell them.   Photos\\n taken outside Westmead Hospital on Sunday showed a young woman wearing a\\n face mask being moved by paramedics with protective gloves, masks and \\nclothing.   Health authorities are now working to track down people the woman came into contact with and potentially infected.\\xa0    Symptoms of coronavirus infection include coughing, fever and breathing difficulties.    Severe cases can lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and death.    The current coronavirus is being transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected host coughs or sneezes.    It can also be spread by touching contaminated surfaces such as hand rails and door handles.    None of the cases detected in Australia has involved local person to person transmission.    Coronavirus\\n has an incubation period of between one and 14 days and there are fears\\n it can be spread before symptoms are showing.

The\\n virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses \\nare a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild lung \\ninfections such as the common cold.   But coronaviruses can also be \\ndeadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a \\ncoronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the \\nearly 2000s.    Can the Wuhan coronavirus kill?    Yes a 170 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus.\\xa0    What are the symptoms?    Some\\n people who catch the Wuhan coronavirus may not have any symptoms at \\nall, or only very mild ones like a sore throat or a headache.   Others may suffer from\\xa0a fever, cough or trouble breathing.\\xa0   And\\n a small proportion of patients will go on to develop severe infection \\nwhich can damage the lungs or cause pneumonia, a life-threatening \\ncondition which causes swelling and fluid build-up in the lungs.    How is it detected?    The\\n virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China and \\ncountries around the world have used this to create lab tests, which \\nmust be carried out to confirm an infection.   Delays to these \\ntests, to test results and to people getting to hospitals in China, mean\\n the number of confirmed cases is expected to be just a fraction of the \\ntrue scale of the outbreak.\\xa0\\xa0    How did it start and spread?    The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.   Cases have since been identified around China and are known to have spread from person to person.    What are countries doing to prevent the spread?    Countries\\n in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South\\n Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.   Australia\\n and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the \\nUK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan.    Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before?    Experts\\n have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory \\nsyndrome (SARS).

'Our\\n greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries \\nwith weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.'   Russia,\\n which has no cases of the virus, is closing its 2,600-mile border with \\nChina, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard \\nagainst the outbreak.   Train traffic between the countries was \\nhalted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air \\ntraffic between the two countries continued.   On Thursday Israel \\nbanned all incoming flights from China and 6,000 people in Italy were \\nprevented from leaving a cruise ship while tests were carried out on a \\npassenger from Macau.   Australia and New Zealand are planning a \\njoint evacuation of citizens from Wuhan while Singapore is setting up a \\nquarantine facility on an island to the city's north-east.

Two\\n arrived on direct flights from Wuhan to Sydney on separate China \\nEastern Airlines flight MU749, one on January 20 and another on an \\nunknown date.   Both these flights had up to 250 passengers plus several crew on board who are prime candidates for infection.   Another\\n man, diagnosed on the same day, flew in to Sydney via Shenzhen, near \\nHong Kong, on January 6 on a plane that carries up to 277 people.

A\\n total of 167 flights that can carry 48,999 people are landing in \\nAustralia from mainland China per week as coronavirus spreads around the\\n world.   Based on those figures, as many as 342,993 people may have\\n entered Australia from China since the deadly virus was first detected \\nin Wuhan seven weeks ago.   On Thursday, major airlines suspended or\\n reduced services to China including British Airways, Lufthansa, \\nAmerican Airlines, KLM, and United.   But the airlines that fly from\\n China to Australia - including eight Chinese airlines and Qantas - made\\n no changes to their routes, except for China Eastern cancelling its \\nflight from Wuhan to Sydney last week.   The flights include 62 \\nplanes from Guangzhou, 42 from Shanghai and 18 from Beijing per week, \\nwith direct routes to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and \\nDarwin.   On Wednesday, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the \\nairline was considering scrapping its Sydney to Beijing route due to low\\n demand.

On Monday, it was confirmed that a 21-year-old \\nUniversity of NSW student who arrived on a different\\xa0MU749 flight \\nwas infected.   The university told students in an email that she \\nbecame unwell soon after her flight and isolated herself in her \\non-campus dorm room for 24 hours before going to hospital.   UNSW is\\n not in semester but there are still some students and staff on campus \\nshe could have interacted with, along with on public transport and at \\nthe airport.   Many students are terrified they could be infected \\nnext, especially with thousands of Chinese classmates due to arrive on \\ncampus in coming weeks.   The second Melbourne patient landed on \\nJanuary 21, though it is not clear which flight he was on, and wasn't \\ndiagnosed until Wednesday.   The man in his 60s went to hospital two days later but was allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day with his family.   He\\n was with five family members - three adults and two children - at The \\nHouse of Delight in Glen Waverley between 5.30pm and 7pm.   Victoria's\\n chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton urged other diners to contact the \\nhealth department and watch for coronavirus symptoms.   Other \\nbusinesses in the same building as the restaurant on\\xa052 Montclair \\nAvenue have closed until February 9 and others are thinking about \\nshutting up shop.   A cleaner was brought in to disinfect buttons in the building's lift.

They\\n all took Tiger Air flight TT566, landing on the Gold Coast about 8pm on\\n Monday on a plane that carries up to 189 passengers.   Queensland Health chief officer Dr Jeannette Young on Thursday said she was concerned about everyone on the plane.   Students at the University of NSW where a classmate was diagnosed with coronavirus say they are too afraid to go back to class   A\\n 21-year-old Chinese student was diagnosed with coronavirus earlier this\\n week after she flew back from Wuhan on January 23\\xa0   'My\\n concern is that those 150-200 people on that plane when he started \\ngetting symptoms and then his 24 hours in the Gold Coast community, I \\nneed to track exactly where he went,' she said.   Tiger Air said it \\nwas in the process of contacting the passengers and crew to notify them \\nso they could visit their GP for testing.   The 44-year-old stayed \\nat an apartment in the Oracle building in Broadbeach, which is in the \\nsame building as the $900-a-night Peppers hotel frequented by \\ncelebrities including Taylor Swift.   He became increasingly unwell \\nafter first developing symptoms before the flight out of Melbourne and \\ncalled an ambulance about 3.30pm on Tuesday.\\xa0\\xa0   A Chinese tourist who arrived in Melbourne early last week was diagnosed on Thursday a week after she got sick.

A 42-year-old woman - who was\\n part of the same tour group - was confirmed on Thursday night as \\nQueensland's second coronavirus case.    WHAT WE KNOW    * The tour group came from Wuhan and stopped in Singapore before flying to Australia.   *They left Singapore on either January 21 or 22, and landed in Melbourne on January 22.   *The group spent the next five days in the Victorian capital touring the city.   *Authorities are now trying to track their movements and alert people who may have been in contact.   *The tour group boarded Tiger Air flight TT566 on January 27 at 7.44pm AEDT and landed at the Gold Coast Airport at 8.45pm AEST.   *The passenger was travelling on a booking with one other person and they were seated in 11A and 11B.   *The 44-year-old developed symptoms on the flight, which was carrying about 150-200 passengers.   *The man travelled to his Gold Coast hotel, before calling an ambulance.

She is now in isolation in a Gold Coast hospital.   *\\n China's women's soccer team, which includes 32 players and staff, \\nremains in isolation at a Brisbane hotel after arriving on Wednesday.   *\\n The federal government plans to evacuate Australians from the Hubei \\ncapital of Wuhan after about 600 citizens and residents registered for \\nhelp to get out. China must approve the plan.   * They will be flown to Christmas Island and put in quarantine for two weeks.   *\\n The federal health department has issued new advice amid evidence the \\nvirus has been spread by people before they develop any symptoms.   *\\n Anyone who has recently been to Hubei or had contact with a confirmed \\ncase must isolate themselves at home for 14 days from the date of their \\ndeparture.   THE WORLD:   * Some 170 people have died from the \\nvirus in mainland China, and the number of confirmed cases is now more \\nthan 7000. Most of the deaths have been in Hubei.   * Some major airlines have halted all flights to China, but so far Qantas is not among them.   *\\n The virus is now affecting most of Australia's regional neighbours \\nincluding Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Cambodia.

Scientists are still trying to fully understand this strain of coronavirus and work out how contagious it is and how to stop it.   The\\n infection rate of diseases is called its basic reproduction number, \\nknown as R0 or r-nought, brought to public attention by 2011 film \\nContagion about a fictional worldwide pandemic.   Imperial College \\nLondon estimated coronavirus'\\xa0R0 to be 2.6, meaning that on average\\n each patient would infect 2.6 others before they died, were isolated, \\nor got better.   This number changes over time as the virus spreads \\nor is brought under control by health authorities - an R0 of less than 1\\n means it is under control.\\xa0   Paramedics wearing Hazmat\\n suits arrived at Peppers, on Elizabeth Street, Broadbeach, to reports \\nof a suspected coronavirus case on Tuesday   The \\nluxurious 4.5 star hotel is a hot-spot for celebrities, and is \\nunderstood to have hosted popstar Taylor Swift and, then boyfriend, Tom \\nHiddleston in 2016   Measles is particularly contagious, with a\\n score as high as 16, while SARS was 2 to 5, as is HIV, while a standard\\n flu is about 1.3.   Some particularly deadly diseases, like ebola, \\nhave low scores because they kill patients too fast to infect many \\npeople, or produce symptoms too fast.   Coronavirus has a mortality \\nrate of about 2 per cent, compared to\\xa09.5 per cent for SARS and \\n34.5 per cent in the 2012 MERS outbreak.   Australia is starting at a low base of infection, but this can quickly multiply if the average R0 observed in China is met.

The patients, who were treated at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, have safely recovered and are no longer infectious.   Health\\n Minister Greg Hunt confirmed their release in a press conference on \\nFriday afternoon - as he ruled out banning flights from China to \\nAustralia.   Thousands of people could have been exposed to coronavirus in Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone   Flat-out: Exhausted health professionals in the Chinese province of Hubei where the coronavirus is spreading    Members of a medical team prepare to leave for Wuhan in Hubei Province on 27 January to help treat patients   He\\n said: 'We still have two in New South Wales that are being treated here\\n at Westmead Hospital. The other two that were being housed here have \\nbeen released after it was determined that they were medically clear to \\ngo home.'   Mr Hunt also said that preparations are under way on \\nChristmas Island which will house Australian citizens who request to be \\nevacuated from Wuhan, where the virus was first detected on 12 December.   There are around 600 still in China's Hubei province - but it is not known how many will request evacuation.   'I\\n have spoken with the director of the National Critical Care and Trauma \\nCentre this morning and he has confirmed they have a team of 24 and the \\nfirst members of those will arrive today,' he said.   Ministers do \\nnot yet know when Australians can be evacuated from China because \\nnegotiations are still ongoing with Beijing.\\xa0   The plan is to \\nfly them to Christmas Island off WA and keep them quarantined until they\\n are safe to return to the Australian mainland.   Up to 49,000 \\npeople land on flights from China per week but Australian Chief Medical \\nOfficer Brendan Murphy said there were no plans to stop the planes.   He\\n said: 'The World Health Organization strongly recommends that nations \\ndo not ban flights from China because unless you lockdown exit from the \\ncountry, banning direct flights, doesn't stop people coming from \\nChina.\\xa0   'They could come from all sorts of other ports and at\\n least we know who is coming from China and we can meet and do very \\nintensive border measures for those flights.'   Meanwhile, there are\\n fears thousands of people could have been exposed to the coronavirus in\\n Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone.\\xa0   Four people in Sydney, three in  Melbourne , and two on the  Gold Coast  have been struck down with the deadly virus in recent weeks.   Each one flew in from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, on planes packed with hundreds of potential victims.   At least a day passed after they arrived before they developed flu-like symptoms and eventually went to hospital.   A\\n passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney \\nAirport on Thursday, getting off the last flight to Australia from Wuhan\\n before they were shut down   \\xa0The\\n executive director of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response \\nCentre, Professor Len Notaras said the doctors, nurses and allied health\\n officials being sent to Christmas Island were of the 'highest calibre' \\nand were being drawn from every state and territory.\\xa0   A demountable hospital will be set up including diagnostic and protective equipment and negative pressure facilities.   However,\\n Prof Notaras told reporters in Darwin it was important to note those \\npeople who will be placed in isolation were not sick at this stage and \\nwould likely not become sick.   He said they would not be held in detention, although their movements would be restricted.   Should\\n any begin to show symptoms or become seriously ill the medical team on \\nthe island would make the initial call on their continued treatment.   Anyone\\n who became critically ill would likely be repatriated to Australia, \\npossibly to WA or to a hospital close to where they live, Prof Notaras \\nsaid.   Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia's actions were \\ndriven by medical advice, and the World Health Organisation was strong \\nin its support for quarantine measures to stem the spread of the virus.   'Our\\n job is to protect Australians and provide support for citizens overseas\\n and the best way to do that is to find a place which was designed to \\ndeal with people who were coming (from) overseas ... and to do that in a\\n way which is humane,' Mr Hunt said.   Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton defended the Christmas Island plan, saying it would help keep Australia safe.   'I\\n can't clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 \\npeople. We don't have a facility otherwise that can take this number of \\npeople,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday.   Christmas Island \\nadministrator Natasha Griggs said residents had expressed some concerns \\nbut had been assured that all necessary measures had been put in place \\nto ensure the safety of locals.   'By and large, the Christmas \\nIsland residents understand that this is a humanitarian mission and \\nthey're generally supportive,' she said.   'We've got a fantastic \\nteam of people that have got experience in doing this, a track record of\\n success so the residents of Christmas Island have no need to worry.'   But\\n Australian Medical Association boss Tony Bartone said there were better\\n alternatives to sending evacuees to Christmas Island, with some medical\\n specialists suggesting the Woodside army barracks near Adelaide and \\nanother facility just north of Katherine in the NT.\\xa0   During\\n this time when they didn't know they were sick, they interacted with \\nhundreds of people each, some of whom could now be infected.\\xa0\\xa0   One\\n patient was even allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day at\\n a restaurant with his family while he was waiting for test results.   People\\n they infected will be going about their lives on crowded trains and \\nbuses, having business meetings, and sharing meals - potentially passing\\n the virus on.   This is just from the nine confirmed cases - more \\nthan a dozen other people are being tested after developing symptoms \\nassociated with the virus.   It comes as China's coronavirus death toll hits 170 and the World Health Organisation declares a global health emergency.   Speaking\\n to reporters, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \\n'The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is \\nhappening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.   'Our\\n greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries \\nwith weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.'   Russia,\\n which has no cases of the virus, is closing its 2,600-mile border with \\nChina, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard \\nagainst the outbreak.   Train traffic between the countries was \\nhalted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air \\ntraffic between the two countries continued.   On Thursday Israel \\nbanned all incoming flights from China and 6,000 people in Italy were \\nprevented from leaving a cruise ship while tests were carried out on a \\npassenger from Macau.   Australia and New Zealand are planning a \\njoint evacuation of citizens from Wuhan while Singapore is setting up a \\nquarantine facility on an island to the city's north-east.

The patients, who were treated at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, have safely recovered and are no longer infectious.   Health\\n Minister Greg Hunt confirmed their release in a press conference on \\nFriday afternoon - as he ruled out banning flights from China to \\nAustralia.   He said: 'We still have two in New South Wales that are\\n being treated here at Westmead Hospital. The other two that were being \\nhoused here have been released after it was determined that they were \\nmedically clear to go home.'   Mr Hunt also said that preparations \\nare under way on Christmas Island which will house Australian citizens \\nwho request to be evacuated from Wuhan, where the virus was first \\ndetected on 12 December.   Flat-out: Exhausted health professionals in the Chinese province of Hubei where the coronavirus is spreading    Members of a medical team prepare to leave for Wuhan in Hubei Province on 27 January to help treat patients   There are around 600 still in China's Hubei province - but it is not known how many will request evacuation.   'I\\n have spoken with the director of the National Critical Care and Trauma \\nCentre this morning and he has confirmed they have a team of 24 and the \\nfirst members of those will arrive today,' he said.   Ministers do \\nnot yet know when Australians can be evacuated from China because \\nnegotiations are still ongoing with Beijing.\\xa0   The plan is to \\nfly them to Christmas Island off WA and keep them quarantined until they\\n are safe to return to the Australian mainland.   Up to 49,000 \\npeople land on flights from China per week but Australian Chief Medical \\nOfficer Brendan Murphy said there were no plans to stop the planes.   He\\n said: 'The World Health Organization strongly recommends that nations \\ndo not ban flights from China because unless you lockdown exit from the \\ncountry, banning direct flights, doesn't stop people coming from \\nChina.\\xa0   'They could come from all sorts of other ports and at\\n least we know who is coming from China and we can meet and do very \\nintensive border measures for those flights.'   Meanwhile, there are\\n fears thousands of people could have been exposed to the coronavirus in\\n Australia by the country's nine confirmed patients alone.\\xa0   Four people in Sydney, three in  Melbourne , and two on the  Gold Coast  have been struck down with the deadly virus in recent weeks.   Each one flew in from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, on planes packed with hundreds of potential victims.   At least a day passed after they arrived before they developed flu-like symptoms and eventually went to hospital.   A\\n passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney \\nAirport on Thursday, getting off the last flight to Australia from Wuhan\\n before they were shut down   \\xa0The\\n executive director of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response \\nCentre, Professor Len Notaras said the doctors, nurses and allied health\\n officials being sent to Christmas Island were of the 'highest calibre' \\nand were being drawn from every state and territory.\\xa0   A demountable hospital will be set up including diagnostic and protective equipment and negative pressure facilities.   However,\\n Prof Notaras told reporters in Darwin it was important to note those \\npeople who will be placed in isolation were not sick at this stage and \\nwould likely not become sick.   He said they would not be held in detention, although their movements would be restricted.   Should\\n any begin to show symptoms or become seriously ill the medical team on \\nthe island would make the initial call on their continued treatment.   Anyone\\n who became critically ill would likely be repatriated to Australia, \\npossibly to WA or to a hospital close to where they live, Prof Notaras \\nsaid.   Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia's actions were \\ndriven by medical advice, and the World Health Organisation was strong \\nin its support for quarantine measures to stem the spread of the virus.   'Our\\n job is to protect Australians and provide support for citizens overseas\\n and the best way to do that is to find a place which was designed to \\ndeal with people who were coming (from) overseas ... and to do that in a\\n way which is humane,' Mr Hunt said.   Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton defended the Christmas Island plan, saying it would help keep Australia safe.   'I\\n can't clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 \\npeople. We don't have a facility otherwise that can take this number of \\npeople,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday.   Christmas Island \\nadministrator Natasha Griggs said residents had expressed some concerns \\nbut had been assured that all necessary measures had been put in place \\nto ensure the safety of locals.   'By and large, the Christmas \\nIsland residents understand that this is a humanitarian mission and \\nthey're generally supportive,' she said.   'We've got a fantastic \\nteam of people that have got experience in doing this, a track record of\\n success so the residents of Christmas Island have no need to worry.'   But\\n Australian Medical Association boss Tony Bartone said there were better\\n alternatives to sending evacuees to Christmas Island, with some medical\\n specialists suggesting the Woodside army barracks near Adelaide and \\nanother facility just north of Katherine in the NT.\\xa0   During\\n this time when they didn't know they were sick, they interacted with \\nhundreds of people each, some of whom could now be infected.\\xa0\\xa0   One\\n patient was even allowed out of isolation to celebrate Australia Day at\\n a restaurant with his family while he was waiting for test results.   People\\n they infected will be going about their lives on crowded trains and \\nbuses, having business meetings, and sharing meals - potentially passing\\n the virus on.   This is just from the nine confirmed cases - more \\nthan a dozen other people are being tested after developing symptoms \\nassociated with the virus.   It comes as China's coronavirus death toll hits 170 and the World Health Organisation declares a global health emergency.   Speaking\\n to reporters, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \\n'The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is \\nhappening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.   'Our\\n greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries \\nwith weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.'   Russia,\\n which has no cases of the virus, is closing its 2,600-mile border with \\nChina, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard \\nagainst the outbreak.   Train traffic between the countries was \\nhalted except for one train connecting Moscow and Beijing, but air \\ntraffic between the two countries continued.   On Thursday Israel \\nbanned all incoming flights from China and 6,000 people in Italy were \\nprevented from leaving a cruise ship while tests were carried out on a \\npassenger from Macau.   Australia and New Zealand are planning a \\njoint evacuation of citizens from Wuhan while Singapore is setting up a \\nquarantine facility on an island to the city's north-east.

They will stay at a \\nquarantine centre on the island 2,600 kilometres from the mainland for \\ntwo weeks before they return home.\\xa0   Professor Drew told  The Australian  previous research in pigs showed how coronavirus could become more lethal over time.   He\\n said\\xa0the contagion needs to be regarded as a 'cloud' of closely \\nmatched pathogens rather than one virus with the potential to become \\neven deadlier in 'a 'high-host-density environment' such as China.   'You may well find that more virulent viruses emerge from that cloud,' Professor Drew said.\\xa0   'What\\n I am thinking might be happening here is not that people have been \\ninfected for some time with this virus, but that it is finding a new \\nniche rather more slowly and that could ultimately cause more of a \\nproblem than we have seen with other diseases because it is not so \\nspectacular early on in its evolution.'

Chinese visitors to Australia spent \\nalmost $12billion in the past year and major shopping centres in Sydney,\\n Melbourne and the Gold Coast are popular attractions.     What is the coronavirus?  \\xa0   A\\n coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and \\npeople. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to \\nreproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses \\nare named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they\\n are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The \\ncoronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this \\noutbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on\\n Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory \\nSyndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed \\naround one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a \\n'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named \\nafter it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr\\n Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a \\nfamily of viruses that infect a wide range of different species \\nincluding humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild \\nanimals.\\xa0   'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there \\nwere only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of \\nthese cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has \\nbeen the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and \\nresult in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \\nand Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).\\xa0   'Coronaviruses\\n are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another \\nand that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new \\ncoronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet \\nknown.'\\xa0    The first human cases were publicly reported \\nfrom the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people \\nlive, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on \\nDecember 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had \\nbeen reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were \\ndeveloped for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The\\n first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 \\ncases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 \\npeople had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.\\xa0     Where does the virus come from?    According\\n to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from \\nbats.\\xa0Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the \\nsimilar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet \\ncats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came \\nfrom people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which \\nhas since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market \\nis officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being\\n sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, \\nporcupines and camel meat.\\xa0   A study by the\\xa0Wuhan \\nInstitute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific \\njournal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in \\npatients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found \\nin bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so \\nscientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a \\nmiddle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a \\nhuman. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr\\n Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not \\ninvolved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places \\nthe origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether\\n another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, \\nand possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host \\nmight have been.'\\xa0\\xa0    So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?\\xa0    Experts\\n say the international community is concerned about the virus because so\\n little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It\\n is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 \\nin an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus \\nwhich infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which\\n killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for\\n COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any \\nimmunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This \\nmeans it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across \\noften, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in \\nJanuary, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel \\nviruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which\\n circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most\\n seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in \\n1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand\\n fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate \\ncould be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.\\xa0   'My\\n feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this \\niceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The\\n illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, \\nmaking it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even\\n before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the \\nsaliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, \\nkissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live\\n on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning \\npeople can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,\\n people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in \\nWuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been \\nthere, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to \\nperson.\\xa0    What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once\\n someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 \\ndays, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still\\n be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, \\ntypical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever \\n(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from \\nthese without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In\\n a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those \\nwith long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an \\ninfection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with \\nfluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left \\nuntreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing \\nthat young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the\\n virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to \\nflu, but it is not clear why.\\xa0      What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?   \\xa0     Scientists\\n in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of \\nthe virus and released them to experts working around the world.\\xa0   This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   Examinations\\n have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known \\nas mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,\\n the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and \\nPrevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it \\nspread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and \\nto potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus \\nmight look different every time scientists analyse it.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   More\\n study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small \\nnumber of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were\\n various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed \\nseparately.    How dangerous is the virus?\\xa0\\xa0    The\\n virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death \\nrate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around \\n50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning\\n of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are \\ninfected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded \\ncases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they \\nnever even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more \\nserious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it \\nreally is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr\\n Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a \\nmission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only \\nshowing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be \\naccurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured? \\xa0   The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics\\n do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral\\n drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then \\ndeveloping and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge \\namounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and \\nit's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this \\noutbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National \\nInstitutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, \\nsay they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about \\ncoronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But \\nthis may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,\\n governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and\\n to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People\\n who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their \\nsymptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected \\npublic.   And airports around the world are putting in place \\nscreening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's \\ntemperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot \\nthose who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,\\n it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small \\nlikelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.    Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   The\\n outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by \\nthe World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new \\ndisease'.\\xa0   Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside \\nof Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't \\nactually spreading actively around the world.

Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to \\nreproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses \\nare named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they\\n are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The \\ncoronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this \\noutbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on\\n Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory \\nSyndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed \\naround one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a \\n'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named \\nafter it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr\\n Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a \\nfamily of viruses that infect a wide range of different species \\nincluding humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild \\nanimals.\\xa0   'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there \\nwere only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of \\nthese cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has \\nbeen the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and \\nresult in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \\nand Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).\\xa0   'Coronaviruses\\n are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another \\nand that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new \\ncoronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet \\nknown.'\\xa0    The first human cases were publicly reported \\nfrom the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people \\nlive, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on \\nDecember 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had \\nbeen reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were \\ndeveloped for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The\\n first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 \\ncases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 \\npeople had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.\\xa0     Where does the virus come from?    According\\n to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from \\nbats.\\xa0Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the \\nsimilar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet \\ncats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came \\nfrom people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which \\nhas since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market \\nis officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being\\n sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, \\nporcupines and camel meat.\\xa0   A study by the\\xa0Wuhan \\nInstitute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific \\njournal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in \\npatients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found \\nin bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so \\nscientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a \\nmiddle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a \\nhuman. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr\\n Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not \\ninvolved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places \\nthe origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether\\n another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, \\nand possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host \\nmight have been.'\\xa0\\xa0    So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?\\xa0    Experts\\n say the international community is concerned about the virus because so\\n little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It\\n is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 \\nin an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus \\nwhich infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which\\n killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for\\n COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any \\nimmunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This \\nmeans it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across \\noften, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in \\nJanuary, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel \\nviruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which\\n circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most\\n seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in \\n1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand\\n fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate \\ncould be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.\\xa0   'My\\n feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this \\niceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The\\n illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, \\nmaking it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even\\n before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the \\nsaliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, \\nkissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live\\n on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning \\npeople can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,\\n people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in \\nWuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been \\nthere, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to \\nperson.\\xa0    What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once\\n someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 \\ndays, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still\\n be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, \\ntypical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever \\n(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from \\nthese without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In\\n a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those \\nwith long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an \\ninfection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with \\nfluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left \\nuntreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing \\nthat young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the\\n virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to \\nflu, but it is not clear why.\\xa0      What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?   \\xa0     Scientists\\n in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of \\nthe virus and released them to experts working around the world.\\xa0   This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   Examinations\\n have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known \\nas mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,\\n the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and \\nPrevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it \\nspread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and \\nto potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus \\nmight look different every time scientists analyse it.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   More\\n study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small \\nnumber of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were\\n various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed \\nseparately.    How dangerous is the virus?\\xa0\\xa0    The\\n virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death \\nrate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around \\n50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning\\n of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are \\ninfected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded \\ncases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they \\nnever even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more \\nserious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it \\nreally is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr\\n Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a \\nmission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only \\nshowing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be \\naccurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured? \\xa0   The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics\\n do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral\\n drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then \\ndeveloping and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge \\namounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and \\nit's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this \\noutbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National \\nInstitutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, \\nsay they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about \\ncoronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But \\nthis may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,\\n governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and\\n to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People\\n who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their \\nsymptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected \\npublic.   And airports around the world are putting in place \\nscreening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's \\ntemperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot \\nthose who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,\\n it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small \\nlikelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.

While captive seals can be seen clapping in zoos and \\naquariums, scientists say this is the first time one of their wild \\ncounterparts has been caught on camera performing the action.   While humans clap to applaud or express approval, in the case of wild grey seals , this gesture signifies quite the opposite.

The newspaper said some students had already been en \\nroute to Australia before the travel ban was announced. The department \\nof home affairs has been contacted for comment.   It comes as some \\nAustralian universities delay their semester return while others are \\noffering special consideration for students unable to get back to \\nAustralia amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.   Universities have \\nbeen scrambling to put in place policies and support for students and \\nstaff dealing with the coronavirus and the  travel ban put in place by the federal government  on Saturday.   There\\n has not been a coordinated response from universities, and their \\npolicies will largely depend on when each university is to begin the \\nsemester.   The Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona \\nJackson, said on Sunday that the focus was on the health and safety of \\npeople at university, and on minimising the disruption to their studies.   Monash\\n University in Melbourne announced on Friday it would delay the start of\\n semester one by one week, now due to start 9 March, along with summer \\nexams, due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus making it \\ndifficult for students to get back to Australia, or out of isolation \\nafter arriving from China.   The University of Sydney announced on \\nSaturday evening it would allow students to enrol up to two weeks after \\nthe start of semester (by 9 March), or let students defer their studies \\nor have fees refunded.   For the University of New South Wales, \\nwhere one student tested positive for coronavirus, students can defer \\ntheir study if affected, and the university will consider late enrolment\\n until the end of February. The university has said it will also \\nconsider allowing students to take courses online.   Queensland \\nUniversity of Technology has said returning students can seek a leave of\\n absence if they cannot return by the end of week two, while new \\nstudents unable to travel from China can defer their studies.   The University of Tasmania has said it will offer online courses to the estimated 1,300 students affected by the travel ban.   The\\n Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and University of Adelaide \\namong others who have said classes will continue as normal, but have \\nencouraged affected students to contact them directly.   China \\nrepresents the biggest market for Australiaas international student \\ntrade, at $12.1bn out of the $37.3bn in the 2018-19 financial year, \\naccording to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.   It is \\nnot just the travel ban and isolation period that will affect students \\nenrolling in Australian universities from China, after the countryas \\nnational education examinations authority last week  cancelled English language testing  in February for students planning to study abroad.   Given\\n the changing response to coronavirus in global attempts to contain the \\nspread, it is still difficult to quantify the economic impact it will \\nhave on the university sector. If the disruption to studying in the wake\\n of the coronavirus continues throughout the first half of this year, it\\n could cost between $6bn and $8bn, according to Phil Honeywood, chief \\nexecutive of the International Education Association of Australia .   Last\\n month the education minister Dan Tehan set up a global reputation \\ntaskforce chaired by Honeywood to determine the impact the bushfires \\nwould have on the international student market, and it has now had its \\nremit expanded to cover the impact from the coronavirus.   The \\ntaskforce met for the first time on Monday and it is expected to suggest\\n to universities a more consistent response to the coronavirus outbreak.   Honeywood\\n said the taskforceas immediate focus would be to get care packages sent\\n out to support those students in Australia who have had to isolate \\nthemselves for 14 days after returning from China.   aThere is a \\ndanger in all of this, and we havenat seen it so far, in racial \\nprofiling, and for Chinese students sitting alone in a four-metre square\\n room wondering what lifeas like having to be by yourself for 14 days,a \\nhe said. aYou want to know that people are thinking of you and caring \\nfor you.a  ', \" Dozens\\n of foreigners who may have been exposed to the potentially deadly \\ncoronavirus are set to be secretly held in isolation at a hotel near the\\n centre of Sydney, a source close to the operation has revealed.\\xa0   Staff involved in the Australian Government's quarantine operation on  Christmas  Island claim security guards from Serco - the company that deploys staff at the  immigration  detention - have been sent to a Sydney hotel to oversee the operation.

About 12 uniformed hostesses and two men were ushered out of the building by hotel staff and straight on to the shuttle bus.   Their luggage was loaded into the back of the bus quickly.   Some of the airline staff also wore protective face masks for the trip.   One of the hostess's said they had been staying in the hotel but were about to board a return flight back to Singapore.   'We're actually just leaving,' she said.   'We've been here a while, but we're flying to Singapore today.'\\xa0   When\\n Daily Mail Australia asked whether they were being monitored for \\ncoronavirus inside the hotel, another air hostess interrupted to say \\nthey could not comment.\\xa0   Within an hour, the same shuttle bus\\n company arrived to do another trip, confirming there were more staff \\nwaiting in the building.\\xa0   A flight attendant from Virgin \\nAustralia later told Daily Mail Australia said it was 'quite scary' to \\nthink quarantine was taking place at the hotel.\\xa0   'I hope not.\\n I'm just here because the normal hotel I stay in before a flight was \\nfull.

Clapping is believed to be used by male  grey seals  as a show of strength to warn competitors to stay away and attract potential mates.   Sharing the full story, not just the headlines   The sound created by the clap is described as a aloud \\nhigh-frequency noisea that cuts through any background noise in order to\\n send a aclear signala to nearby seals.

The effect of the clap was instant and the rival males \\nrapidly dispersed.   aThe clap was incredibly loud and at first I found it hard to \\nbelieve what I had seen. How could a seal make such a loud clap \\nunderwater with no air to compress between its flippers?   aIave heard the distinctive shotgun-like aCrack!a many times over\\n the years and I felt sure this clapping behaviour was the source, but \\nfilming the seals in action has eluded me for 17 years.   aThen one day I had heard a couple of slaps in the distance, I just hit the record button and eureka! I got it!,a he added.   Lead author Dr David Hocking of Monash University said: aThe \\ndiscovery of aclapping sealsa might not seem that surprising, after all,\\n theyare famous for clapping in zoos and aquaria.   aBut where zoo animals are often trained to clap for our \\nentertainment a these grey seals are doing it in the wild of their own \\naccord.   aClapping appears to be an important social behaviour for grey \\nseals, so anything that disturbed it could impact breeding success and \\nsurvival for this species.a   He added that noise pollution created by humans has been known to ainterferea with other forms of communications between  marine mammals , including whale song.   aBut if we do not know a behaviour exists, we cannot easily act to protect it,a he said.  ', '   (CNN) Although seals are known to clap their flippers in captivity, a  gray sea l has been filmed doing it in the wild for the very first time, researchers say.    Ben Burville, a marine biologist at Newcastle University in the UK,  filmed a seal clapping  its flippers together underwater near the Farne Islands, a group of islands off the northeast coast of England.    The seal\\'s clapping produced a distinctive \"crack\" sound.   Burville spent 17 years attempting to capture the behavior on film before finally succeeding in October 2017.   Scientists\\n believe bull seals make the noise underwater to deter competitors \\nduring the mating season, with the loud high-frequency sound sending a \\nstrong message to other males in the vicinity.    The sound was previously thought to be made vocally, but the new video footage   shows a gray seal clapping its flippers to create the noise.    Burville\\n said in a statement that diving with seals was his passion and that he \\nbelieves he has spent \"more time underwater with grey seals than anyone \\nin the world.\"     He added that this previously unseen behavior made him think about \"how much there still is to learn\" about the species.     The\\n footage Burville captured is part of an international study led by \\nMonash University in Australia, which is published on Monday in the \\njournal Marine Mammal Science.    David\\n Hocking, the lead author of the study and a research fellow at Monash, \\nsaid noise pollution from humans interferes with whale song and other \\nmarine-mammal communication.     \"Clapping appears to be an \\nimportant social behaviour for grey seals,\" he added, \"so anything that \\ndisturbed it could impact breeding success and survival for this \\nspecies.\"  ', \"    Published:    13:27 AEDT, 4 February 2020     |    Updated:    18:37 AEDT, 4 February 2020        A disturbing video shows animals including bats, possums, cats and snakes being sold at a busy Indonesian market.

WA authorities have made contingency plans to immediately transport any unwell passengers to hospitals in Perth if needed.

As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 12 cases of coronavirus in Australia, and more than 20,000 people infected worldwide.

Nature    578 , 37 (2020)    doi: 10.1038/d41586-020-00303-1  ', ' Photographs by  David Maurice Smith     Feb. 4, 2020    SYDNEY,\\n Australia a Early on the morning of Dec. 27, Phoebe Meagher, a wildlife\\n conservation officer at Taronga Zoo, set off on a rescue mission with \\ncolleagues from the zoo and academics from the University of New South \\nWales. Several platypuses were trapped in quickly shrinking bodies of \\nwater in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve in the Australian Capital Territory,\\n and wildfires were fast approaching. There was a window of a few days \\nbefore the park would be entirely closed off to the public, and two \\nweeks until the bodies of water would be completely dry.   A \\nfive-hour drive brought the team to what was once a lake. Now, it was \\nmostly deep, sucking mud. The air was hot and smoky. aInitially we \\nthought we werenat going to be trapping until the evening,a Dr. Meagher \\nsaid. Platypuses are nocturnal, usually waking up around sunset. But \\nthese platypuses were already active, which, while concerning, meant the\\n team could see where they were.   aThere was hardly any water \\nthere,a Dr. Meagher said. aSo they couldnat duck down and hide and be \\ncryptic like they usually are.a   Platypuses are difficult to catch;\\n they are fast, slippery swimmers and desperately shy. The males also \\nhave a sharp, venomous spur behind one of their hind feet. The venom is \\nnot lethal to humans, but there is no antidote, and the pain can last \\nmonths.   The scientists dragged a net through\\n the remaining water in four areas of the reserve. With the help of a \\nsmall aluminum boat and a pool scooper, they caught two males and five \\nfemales. The animals were placed into cotton pillowcases, then given \\nhealth checks a while suspended upside down by their tails a and driven \\nto the zoo in Sydney, where they will probably remain for months, until \\nenough rain has fallen to replenish Tidbinbillaas supplies.   One of\\n the biggest issues facing the zoo was that other reserves were asking \\nthem to rescue their platypuses, too, but Taronga didnat yet have the \\nspace. aI donat think drought and bushfires are going away,a Dr. Meagher\\n said. aWe have to prepare for these types of climatic disasters moving \\nforward more and more.a She was spending her days asking, aHow do we \\nhave the resources to be able to say, aAll right, letas go rescue 50 \\nplatypusa?a   The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the platypus as near-threatened. In January,  a study \\n by scientists from the University of New South Wales and the University\\n of Melbourne estimated that climate change could lead the number of \\nplatypuses to decline by as much as 73 percent in the next 50 years. \\nLast October, scientists from the University of New South Wales \\npublished  a study in Global Ecology and Conservation  showing that for the last decade there had been no records of platypuses in 41 percent of their previous range.   December was Australiaas  hottest and driest December on record ; 2019 was its  hottest and driest year on record ;\\n and the country has been experiencing a severe drought for three years,\\n a key factor in why the ongoing wildfires have been so severe. \\nPlatypuses are found mainly along the east coast of Australia, which has\\n been the area worst impacted by the fires. The eastern states are also \\nhome to  80 percent of Australiaas human population .   In\\n January, Aussie Ark, an animal welfare organization, discovered two \\ndead platypuses in dried up waterways. The group relocated four others \\nand took five more into their care. Platypuses are also threatened by \\npollution, land clearing and predation from invasive species, including \\nfoxes and feral dogs and cats a especially when platypuses choose to \\ntravel over land to seek out new bodies of water. (They can retract the \\nwebbing on their feet to walk with their claws.) In the 19th century, \\ntens of thousands of platypuses were killed for their thick pelts, which\\n were turned into slippers or rugs.   Gilad Bino, a researcher at \\nthe University of New South Wales and the lead author on the January \\nplatypus study, said that old newspapers and studies described seeing aa\\n dozen platypus in a pool, and using words that we would never use now, \\nlike aplatypus migrationa.a Today there are nothing like those numbers. \\nAustralia has the  worst mammal extinction rates  in the world.   In 2018, scientists at Monash University estimated that some platypuses could be ingesting  half a human dose of antidepressants  from aquatic insects in streams near Melbourne, which have been shown to have high levels of these and other drugs.   An\\n Aboriginal dreamtime story about the platypus (one indigenous name for \\nthe animal is Dharragarra) explains its origin as the product of a \\ncourtship between a water rat and a duck. Platypuses have fur, bills, \\nwebbed feet and a beaver-like tail, and they lay eggs. The only other \\negg-laying mammal is the echidna, also endemic to Australia. Young \\nplatypuses live with their mothers for up to four months, suckling on \\nmilk released through pores on the motheras chest. They evolved 120 \\nmillion years ago and offer insight into the link between mammals and \\nreptiles.   Platypuses may be of value for human medicine. Their milk contains a unique antibacterial protein that could lead to  new, superbug-resistant antibiotics , according to scientists at Deakin University in Australia. Their venom might help  fight Type 2 diabetes ;\\n in 2016, scientists at Flinders University and the University of \\nAdelaide discovered that platypus venom contained a long-lasting hormone\\n that promotes the release of insulin.   Robert Dockerill, a senior \\nkeeper at Taronga Zoo, describes platypuses as aDr. Frankensteinas first\\n attempt.a He likes to joke that platypuses and echidnas are the only \\nanimals that can make custard, because they produce both eggs and milk. \\nForty years ago, he said, he watched platypuses swimming at his \\ngreat-uncleas farm in Armidale, on the North Coast of New South Wales. \\nThe town has been hit particularly hard by the drought. Then, in \\nJanuary, rain washed soil and ash from the bushfires into the Macleay \\nRiver,  causing thousands of fish to die .   As\\n he spoke, Mr. Dockerill stood in front of a tank at Taronga Zoo that \\nheld one of the rescued platypuses, a male. aHeas pretty much done \\nnothing but eat since he got here,a he said. He noted that one way to \\ntell the health of a platypus was to use the atail volume index.a \\nPlatypuses store fat in their tails; the more a tail can bend, the less \\nfat it holds. When the male had come in, he had a T.V.I. of four, five \\nbeing the worst. He was now almost a one.   The room housing the \\nplatypuses was dark, so that they would be active, thinking it was \\nnighttime. Their tanks, decorated with fresh eucalyptus branches and \\nfern fronds, glowed faintly. The rescued platypus dove through the \\nleaves, wriggling its head as it searched the small pebbles in the tank \\nfloor for food. Platypuses use their bills to detect the electric fields\\n emitted by their prey, which consist mostly of invertebrates. They are \\nparticularly fond of ayabbies,a small blue freshwater crayfish.   Yet\\n another threat faced by platypuses are yabby traps, also known as Opera\\n House traps because of their shape. Platypuses need to surface in order\\n to breathe, but the traps keep them underwater, and they drown. Opera \\nHouse traps are illegal in Victoria, parts of New South Wales and the \\nAustralian Capital Territory.   As\\n the rescued male dived, a steady stream of bubbles emerged from his \\nbody. The effect, actually caused by air trapped in their fur, gave rise\\n to an early misconception about platypuses, that they abreathed through\\n their butts,a Mr. Dockerill said.   The male climbed onto a \\nplatform and changed positions like a swimsuit model posing for a \\nphotograph a at one point pressing his belly against the glass. In a \\nnearby tank, Annie the platypus, a longtime Taronga resident, rolled \\nonto her back, scratching herself with a webbed foot. Mr. Dockerill \\nraised Annie by hand after she was brought into the zoo with injuries \\ninflicted by a dog.   aI donat care what the zoo says, sheas mine,a \\nhe said, smiling. Often, he gives her a scratch in the mornings, but \\nthat day he could not visit any of the zooas platypuses; he had already \\nworked with the wild ones, which were under quarantine, which meant he \\nwas too.   Through a private door leading away from\\n the public exhibit, and up narrow metal stairs were two more tanks a \\nand the opening above the rescued maleas tank, into which Mr. Dockerill \\nscattered live beetle larvae and fly pupae. The other tanks each held a \\nrescued female and several bright blue yabbies, which appeared to wait \\nnervously on branches of eucalyptus floating in the water. Suddenly, one\\n of the females caught a yabby and proceeded to roll and shake it to \\ndeath, like a tiny, furry crocodile.   Richard \\nKingsford, an aquatic ecologist at the University of New South Wales and\\n another author of the recent study documenting the decline in platypus \\nnumbers, also grew up watching platypuses in the river, in his case the \\nAbercrombie River, west of Sydney.   He described their courtship \\nritual. aThey seem to do this weird tumble turning, where they sort of \\ngo around in circles within the water, chasing each other,a he said. \\nDuring the ritual, the male and female nip at each otheras tails.   Australia\\n is the worldas driest inhabited continent. Man-made dams, and the \\ndiversion of water to irrigated agriculture, have had a significant \\nimpact on biodiversity, Dr. Kingsford said. Last week, fires flared up \\nagain in the Australian Capital Territory, moving closer to Tidbinbilla.\\n Rangers at the reserve began catching and relocating other species, \\nincluding brush-tailed rock wallabies, Northern Corroboree frogs and \\nbettongs (also known as rat-kangaroos), the  Canberra Times reported . On Jan. 31 the government declared a state of emergency in the territory.   Dr.\\n Bino, the lead author on the paper published in January, said that the \\ncurrent trajectory a aif we continue to clear land and not improve the \\nhabitat, and if youare assuming that demand for fresh water is going to \\nincrease over time, and then you add climate changea a will only further\\n the disappearance of the platypus. As local populations fragment and \\ngrow ever smaller, he said, ait becomes quite easy for us to drive a \\nspecies to extinction.a  ', \"    Published:    18:54 AEDT, 4 February 2020     |    Updated:    18:59 AEDT, 4 February 2020        Eastwood in Sydney's north west has become a veritable ghost town amid fears of the deadly coronavirus.\\xa0   Businesses\\n in the usually bustling area are struggling as people avoid the suburb \\npartly due to hysteria on social media saying the suburb was hit by the \\noutbreak.

Currently, \\n58,797 Chinese international students are within Australia.   Monash University in Melbourne announced on Friday  it would delay its semester by one week , until 9 March.   The president of the National Union of Students, Molly Willmott, told Guardian Australia she supported the delay.   aI\\n havenat seen the petition itself, but I think there are wider issues \\nwith the travel ban. A lot of experts have come out and said it was an \\noverstep.a   The World Health Organisation said on Friday that  it did not recommend travel restrictions , but prime minister Scott Morrison said the ban was based on advice from Australian medical experts.   aWhat\\n the petition is indicative of is the government making decisions \\nwithout consulting international students or thinking about the \\nlong-term impact it can have on students,a Willmott said.   aWhat \\nhappens when you are quarantining students for two weeks? Are there \\nsupport services in place to support them in that? It is an incredibly \\nstressful and literally isolating time for students. We have to make \\nsure our student services and counselling services are fully funded and \\nhave the right resources.a   Donohoe said that many of the students \\nwho had been blocked ahavenat been to Wuhan or other affected areasa, \\nwhich made the restrictions aparticularly callousa.   On Tuesday, it\\n was reported that 70 international students, some of whom had already \\nbeen en route to Australia when the travel ban was announced,  had been detained  upon arrival at Sydney airport.   The\\n University of Sydney student union, along with the New South Wales \\nbranch of the National Tertiary Education Union are organising a protest\\n calling for a ahealth-based policy response to the coronavirusa, rather\\n than aan approach based on fear and sinophobiaa.   A University of \\nSydney spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald the university had no \\nplans to delay semester but was aaware of the petition and understand \\nthe anxiety and concerna of students.   The university has however \\nextended the period that students can enrol by two weeks a until 9 March\\n a and will let affected international students defer their studies for \\nthe semester.   The University of Melbourne also said it would not delay semester, but would aconsider special arrangements for studentsa.   The two universities, and many others, are also offering online replacements for classes.   The\\n chair of Universities Australia, Prof Deborah Terry, said in a \\nstatement that universities were aworking round the clocka and would \\naextend the greatest flexibility possiblea.   aWe want to ensure as \\nlittle disruption as possible to your studies a so please keep in touch \\nwith your university here in Australia as we keep you updated,a she \\nsaid. aYou are a vital part of our vibrant, warm, global community of \\nstudents and scholars.a   The president of the University of \\nMelbourneas student union, Hannah Buchan, said it was important that ano\\n student should be disadvantaged by this travel bana.   aI believe \\nthat universities need to provide more support for students who are \\naffected by the ban, such as extending special consideration, providing \\nonline materials for the beginning of the semester for all courses, and \\nproviding advocacy and counselling services in different languages,a she\\n said.  ', ' As a metal platform rises from a vat of \\nliquid resin, it pulls an intricate white shape from the liquid a like a\\n waxy creature emerging from a lagoon. This machine is the worldas \\nfastest resin-based 3D printer and it can create a plastic structure as \\nlarge as a person in a few hours, says Chad Mirkin, a chemist at \\nNorthwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The machine, which Mirkin\\n and his colleagues reported last October  1  ,\\n is one of a slew of research advances in 3D printing that are \\nbroadening the prospects of a technology once viewed as useful mainly \\nfor making small, low-quality prototype parts. Not only is 3D printing \\nbecoming faster and producing larger products, but scientists are coming\\n up with innovative ways to print and are creating stronger materials, \\nsometimes mixing multiple materials in the same product.   Sportswear\\n firms, aviation and aerospace manufacturers and medical-device \\ncompanies are eager to take advantage. aYouare not going to be sitting \\nin your home, printing out exactly what you want to repair your car any \\ntime soon, but major manufacturing companies are really adopting this \\ntechnology,a says Jennifer Lewis, a materials scientist at Harvard \\nUniversity in Cambridge, Massachusetts.   The latest techniques \\ncould be lucrative for researchers, many of whom a Lewis and Mirkin \\namong them a are already commercializing their work. Theyare also \\nfundamentally exciting, says Iain Todd, a metallurgist at the University\\n of Sheffield, UK. aWe can get performance out of these materials that \\nwe didnat think we could get. Thatas whatas really exciting to a \\nmaterials scientist. This is getting people used to the new weird.a   The\\n 3D printing technique is also referred to as aadditive manufacturinga, \\nbecause instead of chopping or milling a shape out of a larger block, or\\n casting molten material in a mould, it involves building objects from \\nthe bottom up. Its advantages include less waste and an ability to print\\n custom designs, such as intricate lattice structures, that are \\notherwise hard to create. Low-cost hobbyist machines print by squeezing \\nout thin plastic filaments from heated nozzles, building up a structure \\nlayer by layer a a method known as fused deposition modelling (FDM). But\\n the term 3D printing encompasses a much wider range of techniques. One \\nof the oldest uses an ultraviolet laser to scan across and solidify (or \\nacurea) light-sensitive resin, layer by layer. That concept was \\ndescribed as far back as 1984, in a patent filed by Charles Hull  2  , the founder of a company called 3D Systems in Rock Hill, South Carolina.   The\\n latest techniques a including Mirkinas a still use light-sensitive \\nresin, but are faster and larger-scale, following improvements reported \\nin 2015 by a team led by Joseph DeSimone, a chemist and materials \\nscientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  3  .\\n Early printers were slow, small-scale and prone to producing layered, \\nimperfect and weak structures. These found a niche in rapid prototyping,\\n making plastic model parts as mock-ups for later production by \\nconventional methods. As an area of research, this kind of printing \\nwasnat thrilling, says Timothy Scott, a polymer scientist at Monash \\nUniversity in Melbourne, Australia: aBasically making trinkets and \\nknick-knacks. For a polymer chemist, it was pretty dull.a         In 2015, Joseph DeSimone at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill unveiled a technique to speed up 3D printing.  Credit: Carbon 3D Inc.    Then DeSimone unveiled a way to  print light-sensitive resin up to 100 times faster  than conventional printers  3  .\\n It uses a stage submerged in a vat of resin. A digital projector shines\\n a pre-programmed image up at the stage through a transparent window in \\nthe floor of the vat. The light cures an entire resin layer at once. \\nDeSimoneas advance was to make the window permeable to oxygen. This \\nkills the curing reaction and creates a thin buffer layer, or adead \\nzonea, just above the windowas surface so that the resin doesnat stick \\nto the bottom of the vat each time a layer is printed. The stage rises \\ncontinually, pulling the completed part up through the liquid as new \\nlayers are added at the bottom.   Other labs were working on similar\\n concepts at the time, says Lewis. But perhaps most impressive about \\nDeSimoneas resins was that they could undergo a second reaction in a \\npost-print heat treatment to strengthen the finished product. aIt opens \\nup a much broader array of materials,a says Lewis.   Many research \\ngroups and firms have since built on the work. Mirkinas printer pumps a \\nlayer of clear oil across the bottom of the vat to inhibit the polymeras\\n reactions. This also acts as a coolant, removing heat that can deform a\\n printed part a and it means that the equipment is not limited to \\nprinting with resins that are inhibited by oxygen. He says the printer \\nproduces material ten times faster than DeSimoneas. And last January, \\nScott and his colleague Mark Burns at the University of Michigan in Ann \\nArbor reported a printer that inhibits the reactions by mixing into the \\nresin a chemical that can be activated by a second lamp emitting a \\ndifferent wavelength of light  4  .\\n By varying the ratio of the strength of the two light sources, the \\nresearchers can control the thickness of the photo-inhibited zone, \\nallowing the creation of more complicated patterns, such as surfaces \\nembossed with seals or logos.   Inventions in 3D printing often have\\n rapid commercial potential: some researchers start forming companies \\nbefore they publish their advances. On the same day DeSimoneas paper was\\n published, for instance, he  showcased it at a TED talk \\n in Vancouver, Canada, and officially launched his start-up firm Carbon \\n3D in Redwood City, California, although he had quietly registered the \\ncompany two years earlier. The firm is now one of the biggest start-ups \\nin 3D printing; it has already raised US$680 million in publicly \\ndisclosed funding rounds, and is reportedly valued at $2.4 billion. It \\nhas high-profile contracts with Adidas to make rubber-like midsoles for \\nathletic shoes, and with sports-gear firm Riddell to manufacture \\ncustomized helmet padding for American-football players.        Carbon 3Das technology is used to print Adidas shoes (left) and padding for American football helmets (right).  Credit: Carbon 3D Inc.    Mirkin and his colleagues James Hedrick and David Walker \\nhave also launched a start-up, Azul 3D in Evanston, Illinois, to \\ncommercialize their technique, which they have dubbed HARP (high-area \\nrapid printing). And Scott and Burns are preparing a commercial \\nprototype printer with their Ann Arbor-based start-up Diplodocal, a name\\n derived from the Greek for adouble beama.   New resin-printing \\ntechniques are still emerging. One begins with a small spinning glass \\nholding liquid resin. As the glass rotates, a projector shines a loop of\\n video onto it that corresponds to 2D slices of the desired object. \\nWithin seconds, the final object solidifies inside the liquid resin a no\\n layers necessary  5  .\\n The method is inspired by X-rays and computed-tomography scans, which \\nimage a cross-section of a solid object. This is the inverse: \\nback-projecting cross-sections to form a 3D object.        A projector shines a video loop onto liquid resin, causing an entire object to be created at once, rather than layer by layer.  Credit: UC Berkeley    Even in this fast-moving field, the  technique turned heads \\n for what Lewis calls athe gee-whiz factora. It has significant \\nlimitations: the resin used must be transparent, and the printed object \\nmust be small enough for light to pass through it to cure it. But it \\nalso has a potential advantage: it can handle highly viscous resins, \\nwhich other resin-based printers struggle to suck through the narrow \\ndead zone. That means it could make stronger materials and more accurate\\n prints.   The approach has garnered substantial interest from \\nindustry, says Christopher Spadaccini, a materials and manufacturing \\nengineer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California.\\n Spadaccini was a member of the team that published the work last \\nJanuary  5  .\\n A group at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)\\n independently developed the same concept, and has also reported a \\ndemonstration of it  6  .\\n Spadaccini thinks the technology has tremendous commercial potential \\nbecause it has modest hardware requirements. aIn the end, really, what \\nyou need is a halfway-decent projector and a rotating stage,a he says.   While\\n chemists work on smarter ways to 3D-print intricate resins, engineers \\nare pushing boundaries in 3D printing of concrete a using computers and \\nrobots to precisely automate the pouring process.        A 3D-printed concrete pedestrian bridge developed by Tsinghua University.  Credit: Imaginechina/Shutterstock    The worldas first 3D-printed concrete pedestrian bridge was \\nmade by researchers at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of \\nCatalonia in Barcelona, Spain, and installed in a park in Alcobendas, \\nnear Madrid, in 2016. Twelve metres long, the bridge features a lattice \\nstructure designed with algorithms that maximize strength and reduce the\\n amount of material needed. Other teams have made similar structures, \\nincluding a 26-metre-long bridge in Shanghai, China, produced by \\nengineers at Tsinghua University in Beijing. And teams and companies in \\nChina and the Netherlands have 3D printed demonstration houses.   Those\\n structures arenat constructed in one print job, however: separate \\nsegments are printed and then connected. By producing bridges and houses\\n more cheaply and efficiently, 3D printing could reduce concreteas \\ncarbon footprint a but it could also just encourage engineers to build \\nmore.   Itas not just concrete that is going big: Amsterdam firm \\nMX3D has printed a bridge from stainless steel. First displayed publicly\\n in 2018, the bridge is now being tested and having sensors installed \\nahead of a planned installation over an Amsterdam canal.

The rocket is\\n designed to lift 1,250akilograms into low Earth orbit, and its first \\ntest launch is slated for 2021. Printed metal doesnat always have the \\nsame heat-dissipating performance as non-printed metal, says Relativity \\nSpaceas chief executive, Tim Ellis, but the printing process can add \\ncooling channels in geometries that canat usually be manufactured. \\nBecause rockets are used only once or perhaps a few times, they donat \\nhave to be as strong in the long term as do alloys in aeroplane parts, \\nwhich must resist failure over tens of thousands of pressure cycles, \\nEllis says.

Credit: Relativity Space    These large-scale metal-printed projects are built with \\nrobot arms that feed a thin metal wire to a laser that welds the \\nmaterial into place. Other established ways to print metal use a laser \\nor a beam of electrons to melt or fuse a bed of powder into layers of \\nfinished product. Another technique binds a bed of powder with liquid \\nglue, then sinters the structure in a furnace. And printers designed in \\nthe past few years extrude molten metals through nozzles, in much the \\nsame way as in FDM.   Aviation firms such as Boeing, Rolls Royce and\\n Pratt &amp; Whitney are using 3D printing to make metal parts, mainly \\nfor jet engines. It can be cheaper than milling metal blocks, and the \\nintricate components often weigh less than their conventionally made \\ncounterparts.   But 3D-printed metals are prone to defects that can \\nweaken the final products. Spadaccini and others are trying to use \\narrays of sensors and high-speed cameras to watch for irregularities \\nsuch as hotspots of heat or strain a and then make adjustments in real \\ntime, he says.   Many scientists are also hoping to improve the \\nintrinsic strength of printed metals, sometimes by controlling the \\nmicrostructures of the materials. For instance, in October 2017, a US \\nteam reported that the intense heat and rapid cooling used in \\n3D-printing stainless steel could alter the metalas microstructure such \\nthat the product is stronger than those cast conventionally  7  .\\n And two months ago, researchers in Australia and the United States \\nreported a titaniumacopper alloy with similar strength advantages  8  .\\n As they solidified, previous 3D-printed titanium alloys tended to form \\ngrains that grew in column-like structures. The copper helps to speed up\\n the solidification process, which results in grains that are smaller \\nand sprout in all directions, strengthening the overall structure.   Mark\\n Easton, a materials engineer at RMIT University in Melbourne and one of\\n the leaders of the alloy work, has already had conversations with \\naerospace companies interested in exploring uses for the material. He \\nsays it could also be used in medical implants such as joint \\nreplacements.   Many of the printing techniques that work for metals\\n can also be applied to ceramics, with potential applications that \\ninclude making dental crowns or orthopaedic implants. Moulds for these \\nobjects are already made by 3D printing, with the material cast in the \\nconventional way. But 3D-printing the entire object could save time at \\nthe dentist or surgeonas office.   However, it is harder to control \\nthe microstructure of 3D-printed ceramics, says Eduardo Saiz, a \\nmaterials scientist and ceramicist at Imperial College London. And \\nnearly all practical ceramic printing techniques involve extensive \\npost-print sintering that can warp or deform the part. aIn my opinion, \\nceramics is way behind polymers and metals in terms of practical \\napplications,a he says.   The \\nfieldas future could also lie in a4D printinga a 3D-printed objects that\\n also have the ability to perform some mechanical action, akin to \\nartificial muscles. Often, these incorporate shape-memory polymers, \\nmaterials that can react to changes in their environment such as heat or\\n moisture.   In May 2018, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute\\n of Technology (ETH) in Zurich and the California Institute of \\nTechnology in Pasadena reported printing a submarine that propels itself\\n forward using paddles that snap backwards when placed in warm water  9  .\\n The work could lead to microrobots that can explore the oceans \\nautonomously. But for the moment, the paddles must be reset after each \\nstroke. Such devices could use battery power to reset themselves, but \\nthat makes the machine less efficient than one made conventionally, says\\n Geoff Spinks, a materials engineer at the University of Wollongong in \\nAustralia. aThere are still some big challenges with 4D printing,a he \\nsays.   Another approach to 4D-printed devices involves triggering \\nthe action with a changing external magnetic field. US researchers have \\n3D-printed lattice structures filled with a liquid that changes \\nstiffness in response to a magnetic field  10   a which could perhaps be used to help car seats stiffen on impact.        A fluid that stiffens in response to a magnetic field is \\ninjected into the hollow struts and beams of a 3D-printed lattice. The \\nmaterial can be made stiff or flexible.  Credit: Julie Mancini/LLNL    Other, more passive potential 4D printing applications \\ninclude stents, which could be compressed to be implanted then expanded \\non reaching the desired site in a blood vessel to prop it open. Last \\nJuly, researchers in Switzerland and Italy described a 4D-printed stent \\nthat is just 50 micrometres wide  11  ,\\n much smaller than conventional ones. The devices are so small, the team\\n says, they could one day be used to treat complications in fetuses, \\nsuch as strictures in the urinary tract, which can sometimes be fatal.   Perhaps\\n the most ambitious example of 4D printing is matter that not only \\nmoves, but is alive. Currently, techniques for such bioprinting can \\nprint tissue, such as human skin, that is suitable for lab research, as \\nwell as patches of tissue for livers and other organs that have been \\nsuccessfully implanted in rats. But such techniques are still far from \\nready to integrate into a human body. Researchers dream of printing \\nfully functioning organs that could alleviate long wait lists for organ \\ndonors. aI personally feel weare a decade-plus away from that, at least,\\n if ever,a says Lewis.   Many \\ninventive ideas about printing matter that moves or changes rely on \\nprinting multiple materials together. aThatas absolutely where the field\\n is heading,a says Scott.   \\n   Last November, Lewis and her lab described a printer that can \\nrapidly switch between different polymer inks or mix them as it prints a\\n single object  12  .\\n This means objects can be printed with both flexible and rigid parts. \\nLewis has spun off previous work on multi-material printers into a firm \\ncalled Voxel8, a start-up in Somerville, Massachusetts. Her \\nmulti-material printer could help with the athletics wear that Voxel8 is\\n developing, says Lewis. Wearable devices need to be flexible around \\njoints while also having rigid parts to house electronics. Saiz calls \\nthe printer abeautiful worka, adding wistfully: aThereas nothing like \\nthat for ceramics or metal.a   And in March 2018, a team led by Jerry Qi, a materials engineer at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta,  unveiled a four-in-one printer .\\n This combines a nozzle that extrudes molten polymer with one that \\nprints light-sensitive resin, ready to be cured by ultraviolet lamps or \\nlasers, and two that print wires and circuitry from tiny dots of metal  13  .\\n The print heads work together to make integrated devices with circuits \\nembedded on a rigid board or inside a flexible polymer enclosure. Qi \\nsays his group is now collaborating with electronics companies \\ninterested in printing circuit-board prototypes faster than conventional\\n methods.   It wasnat as simple as bolting four different printers \\ninto one platform: the researchers also needed to develop software that \\nwould allow each print head to communicate with the others and keep \\ntrack of the progress.   The field is still far from delivering on \\nearly visions of bringing mass manufacturing into peopleas homes. For \\nnow, sophisticated printers are too expensive to appeal to \\nnon-specialists. But 3D printing has come a long way in the past 20 \\nyears. Todd remembers people touring his lab in the early 2000s to see \\nhis technique to fuse specks of metal dust together to grow parts. \\nCompared with the conventional milling machines and metal-cutting \\nsystems in neighbouring labs, his 3D-printing machines struck visitors \\nas a complete oddity. aIt was like we were some sort of a dog playing a \\npiano in a bar,a he recalls. Now, for many firms, that trick is standard\\n practice.  ', \" An Air  New Zealand  flight carrying 198 people from Wuhan has landed in Auckland.

Forest scientists from the \\nUniversity of Melbourne said initial results suggested hazard reduction \\nwas best used in a targeted way around assets to help protect them from \\nless intense fires.   It challenges claims by some politicians that \\nstate governments should substantially increase hazard reduction, \\npossibly to meet a target of 5% of land each year. The prime minister, \\nScott Morrison, has suggested he may introduce national standards that \\nwould  report on how much hazard reduction the states carried out each  year.   Speaking\\n in parliament on Wednesday, Morrison said hazard reduction was at least\\n as important as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to protect people as \\nfire seasons worsened.   The University of Melbourne  desktop analysis used Rural Fire Service data \\n to compare the size and severity of this seasonas bushfires area with \\nhazard reduction burns over the past five years. The majority of the \\narea in which there had been prescribed burning had been razed again by \\nbushfire in the past three months.   Patrick Baker, a professor of \\nsilviculture and forest ecology, said the prescribed burning did not \\naseem to have done much at alla in areas that faced a crowning bushfire \\nthat burned the canopy.   He said the fire that devastated the NSW \\nsouth coast between Batemans Bay and Jervis Bay over the new year scored\\n 3.95 out of 4 on a severity scale despite recent hazard reduction burns\\n in the area, some of which scored up to 3.8. aPretty much the whole \\narea was torched,a Baker said.   The analysis found prescribed \\nburning was likely to have helped save property in areas on the fringe \\nof major fire complexes where the flames were less severe, such as \\nKatoomba in the Blue Mountains.   Baker said it suggested prescribed\\n burning was most effective when used as part of a risk-based system \\ndesigned to help protect chosen assets a human life, biodiversity, \\nproperty and water catchments a rather than based on an arbitrary \\nnumeric target. He said a 5% annual target risked leading to swathes of \\nremote landscape being burned without significantly reducing the risk to\\n assets.   In Victoria, for example, burning the sandy soiled \\nlandscape in the Mallee, which makes up nearly a fifth of the state, \\nwould do little to protect assets but could have a catastrophic impact \\non native animals and plants, he said.   aWe need to be smart about \\nwhere we burn,a Baker said. aThe other issue is we donat have endless \\nresources to do this. Itas extraordinarily expensive, so if people want \\nto double or triple or quadruple prescribed burning, the question is \\nwhat else are we not going to get done?a   Morrison announced on \\nTuesday that former a defence chief, Mark Binskin, would lead a royal \\ncommission into the bushfire crisis, which has claimed 33 lives, \\ndestroyed thousands of homes and is estimated to have killed more than \\n1bn animals.   Scientists and former emergency service chiefs say \\nthe climate crisis has exacerbated fire risk and reduced the window each\\n year in which hazard reduction burning can be safely carried out. They \\nsay the increased threat demands both greater resources to fight fires \\nand urgent action to cut emissions.   A group of 31 ex-fire and \\nemergency bosses will write to Morrison on Thursday saying the royal \\ncommission will be a waste of time and money if it does not examine the \\nrole of climate change.   In a statement released on Wednesday \\nnight, Greg Mullins, the former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, said: \\naClimate change has increased fire danger so much that fires now burn \\nfreely through areas that have undergone hazard reduction burning \\nrecently. I saw fires a metre high burning across mown lawns while \\nfighting fires at Batemans Bay on New Yearas Eve.a   The current \\nRural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, told the ABC on \\nWednesday that, while some objected to the description,  the ongoing fire crisis was clearly unprecedented .\\n He said no fire season had taken as many lives, destroyed as many homes\\n and burned through a quarter of the stateas forested country across the\\n Great Dividing Range. aThe reality is it has been an extraordinary, \\ndifficult, damaging, destructive, fatal and tragic fire season, and it \\nis without precedent,a he said.   The 5% annual hazard reduction \\ntarget was recommended by the royal commission into the 2009 Black \\nSaturday bushfires in Victoria, which killed 173 people. Neil Comrie, a \\nformer Victoria police chief commissioner who was appointed to oversee \\nimplementation of the royal commissionas recommendations, later found \\nthe target was likely to not be achievable, affordable or sustainable, \\nand the primary focus should be protection of lives and communities.   The\\n Victorian Andrews government dropped the 5% goal and adopted a \\nrisk-based approach in 2016, pledging to focus on reducing fuel loads \\nclose to communities and in remote back-country areas where fires can \\nstart, grow and build in intensity.   John Thwaites, a former \\nVictorian deputy premier and environment minister and now the chairman \\nof Monash Sustainable Development Institute, said despite claims the \\nstates were not doing enough, fuel reduction had risen 61% in Victoria \\nin the decade following the Black Saturday fires compared with the \\nprevious 10 years.   Even with that increase, the state  met its increased hazard reduction targets only twice \\n before moving to the risk-based system three years ago. It planned to \\nburn 246,000 hectares in 2019, but managed little more than half that \\nbecause it was not safe to burn, officials said.   In NSW, both the \\nNational Parks and Wildlife Service and Rural Fire Service met \\nhectare-based targets for fuel reduction last year, but the rural \\nservice fell short of a goal of limiting fire hazards around 113,130 \\nproperties.   Thwaites said higher temperatures, drier fuel and \\nstronger winds were increasingly making it unsafe to burn in autumn and \\nspring, but a risk-based approach using sophisticated modelling such as \\nthat being adopted in Victoria would reduce the likelihood that homes \\nwere lost.

But owing\\n to difficulties in diagnosing the disease, the cause of death was given\\n as viral pneumonia, the ministry said, citing Chinese medical \\nauthorities.        As of noon on Thursday, 17 foreigners were being\\n treated for the disease in quarantine in China, according to the latest\\n government figures.        The death toll in mainland China rose by\\n 86 to 722 on Saturday, according to authorities, and is poised to pass \\nthe 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 pandemic of Severe\\n Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that jumped from\\n animals to humans in China.        During the SARS outbreak between\\n November 2002 and July 2003, the number of reported cases was 8,098, \\nsuggesting a far lower transmission rate than the latest coronavirus, \\nbut a higher mortality rate.

Reporting by Ryan Woo, Colin \\nQian, Se Young Lee, Yan Zhang, Cheng Leng, Judy Hua and Lusha Zhang in \\nBeijing, and Brenda Goh, Samuel Shen, Yilei Sun in Shanghai; Writing by \\nStephen Coates; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore  ', \"   What is the coronavirus?  \\xa0   A\\n coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and \\npeople. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to \\nreproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses \\nare named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they\\n are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The \\ncoronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this \\noutbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on\\n Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory \\nSyndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed \\naround one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a \\n'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named \\nafter it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr\\n Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a \\nfamily of viruses that infect a wide range of different species \\nincluding humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild \\nanimals.\\xa0   'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there \\nwere only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of \\nthese cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has \\nbeen the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and \\nresult in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \\nand Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).\\xa0   'Coronaviruses\\n are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another \\nand that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new \\ncoronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet \\nknown.'\\xa0    The first human cases were publicly reported \\nfrom the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people \\nlive, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on \\nDecember 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had \\nbeen reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were \\ndeveloped for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The\\n first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 \\ncases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 \\npeople had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.\\xa0     Where does the virus come from?    According\\n to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from \\nbats.\\xa0Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the \\nsimilar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet \\ncats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came \\nfrom people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which \\nhas since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market \\nis officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being\\n sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, \\nporcupines and camel meat.\\xa0   A study by the\\xa0Wuhan \\nInstitute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific \\njournal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in \\npatients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found \\nin bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so \\nscientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a \\nmiddle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a \\nhuman. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr\\n Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not \\ninvolved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places \\nthe origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether\\n another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, \\nand possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host \\nmight have been.'\\xa0\\xa0    So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?\\xa0    Experts\\n say the international community is concerned about the virus because so\\n little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It\\n is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 \\nin an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus \\nwhich infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which\\n killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for\\n COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any \\nimmunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This \\nmeans it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across \\noften, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in \\nJanuary, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel \\nviruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which\\n circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most\\n seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in \\n1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand\\n fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate \\ncould be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.\\xa0   'My\\n feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this \\niceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The\\n illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, \\nmaking it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even\\n before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the \\nsaliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, \\nkissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live\\n on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning \\npeople can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,\\n people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in \\nWuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been \\nthere, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to \\nperson.\\xa0    What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once\\n someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 \\ndays, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still\\n be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, \\ntypical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever \\n(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from \\nthese without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In\\n a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those \\nwith long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an \\ninfection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with \\nfluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left \\nuntreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing \\nthat young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the\\n virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to \\nflu, but it is not clear why.\\xa0      What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?   \\xa0     Scientists\\n in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of \\nthe virus and released them to experts working around the world.\\xa0   This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   Examinations\\n have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known \\nas mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,\\n the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and \\nPrevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it \\nspread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and \\nto potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus \\nmight look different every time scientists analyse it.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   More\\n study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small \\nnumber of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were\\n various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed \\nseparately.    How dangerous is the virus?\\xa0\\xa0    The\\n virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death \\nrate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around \\n50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning\\n of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are \\ninfected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded \\ncases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they \\nnever even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more \\nserious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it \\nreally is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr\\n Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a \\nmission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only \\nshowing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be \\naccurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured? \\xa0   The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics\\n do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral\\n drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then \\ndeveloping and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge \\namounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and \\nit's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this \\noutbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National \\nInstitutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, \\nsay they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about \\ncoronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But \\nthis may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,\\n governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and\\n to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People\\n who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their \\nsymptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected \\npublic.   And airports around the world are putting in place \\nscreening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's \\ntemperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot \\nthose who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,\\n it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small \\nlikelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.    Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   The\\n outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by \\nthe World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new \\ndisease'.\\xa0   Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside \\nof Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't \\nactually spreading actively around the world.  \", \" Parents\\n are concerned hundreds of children might have been exposed to \\ncoronavirus after a year one student returned from a trip to China and \\nattended school.\\xa0   The New South Wales state government issued\\n a warning that any students who had traveled to mainland China recently\\n should not attend classes for two weeks.\\xa0   Despite the \\nadvice, the student reportedly returned to Oran Park Public School in \\nsouth-west Sydney - prompting teachers to send him home after the became\\n aware of his trip to Asia,   The student reportedly returned to Oran Park Public School (pictured) in south-west Sydney after going on a trip to China\\xa0   Airports\\n around the globe are screening passengers amid an outbreak of a new \\nstrain of coronavirus that began in China (pictured\\xa0Changi \\nInternational airport in Singapore on January 22, 2020)\\xa0   The\\n school's principal, Donna Shevlin, sent a letter to parents this week \\nassuring them that the safety of students was top priority, reports  7 News .\\xa0   'A\\n student who recently returned from China has attended school within the\\n medical advice provided by the NSW Health of 14 days self-isolation for\\n people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus,' the letter \\nread.\\xa0   'Once aware of this situation, the school immediately \\nexcluded the student from school for 14 days, with a return date of 10th\\n February.'\\xa0   There is no indication the student in question has shown any symptoms of coronavirus.\\xa0   There are more than 1150 students attending the school.\\xa0\\xa0   Meanwhile, a fifth case of\\xa0 coronavirus  has been confirmed in Queensland.\\xa0   A 37-year-old Chinese woman travelling in Queensland has been confirmed as infected with the deadly virus.   The\\n woman was travelling with the same tour group as the previously \\nconfirmed cases and is currently isolated in a stable condition at  Gold Coast \\xa0Hospital.   All\\n nine members of the tour group are in isolation at Gold Coast \\nUniversity Hospital after they arrived to the city on Tigerair flight \\nTT566 from Melbourne on January 27.\\xa0   A fifth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Queensland. A computer artwork of the virus is pictured\\xa0   A\\n 44-year-old man, a 42-year-old woman, a 37-year-old man and an \\neight-year-old boy from the group have also contracted the \\nillness.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   It's the state's fifth confirmed case \\nof the virus, while there are\\xa0four each in NSW and Victoria, and \\ntwo cases in South Australia   Of those, three people have recovered and been released.   More\\n than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed \\nnearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000 in mainland China.   Two Australians on a cruise ship off Japan also contracted coronavirus after being exposed by a previous passenger.   The\\n pair were among 10 people including three each from Japan and Hong \\nKong, one from the US and one Filipino crew member who tested positive \\naboard the Diamond Princess.\\xa0   Two Australians on the \\nDiamond Princess cruise ship off Japan also contracted coronavirus after\\n being exposed by a previous passenger   More than 100 Australians have been evacuated from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.   Seventy-two\\n people, including infants, were flown on a Qantas flight to Western \\nAustralia on Monday before they were taken to Christmas Island.   Another\\n 35 Australians joined an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland before they\\n were transferred to another flight to join the others.   The group will be held on Christmas Island for 14 days, provided they aren't diagnosed with the illness.\\xa0   Dr\\n Jeanette Young, the state's Chief Health Officer, on Tuesday urged \\nanyone who has returned from mainland China in the past 14 weeks and who\\n feels unwell to seek medical help immediately.   'This is for the safety of those individuals,' she said.   'It's\\n a very early stage of the development of this outbreak, so we don't \\nfully understand what it means to people, so we really want to test \\npeople very early.'   She said she was concerned federal government \\nofficials hadn't handed over all of its data relating to passengers who \\nhad flown from mainland China.   More than 400 people have been assessed for coronavirus since screening started at Brisbane International Airport on Sunday.   Meanwhile,\\n a Sunshine Coast doctor is leading a team of medical experts treating \\nhundreds of Australians evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan to \\nChristmas Island on Monday.   Doctor Daniel Holmes is steering the team providing treatment while the group sits out 14 days of quarantine.

Since 1 February foreign nationals have been  barred from entering Australia within 14 days of leaving China , as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak.   On Friday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Australian universities were a drawing up plans to quarantine thousands of international students a on regional campuses or in student accommodation to reduce disruption to the start of semester.   The University of Sydneyas campus in Camden, 50km from its main site, was listed as a potential site.   But\\n Vicki Thompson, the chief executive of the Group of Eight (Go8), told \\nGuardian Australia this was not under consideration by its universities.   The\\n Go8 comprises the University of Sydney, UNSW, ANU, the University of \\nMelbourne, Monash, the University of Queensland, the University of \\nAdelaide and the University of WA.   A spokeswoman for the University of Sydney said it had ano plans to use our Camden campus for isolation purposesa.   Under\\n the current travel restrictions, any student who had left China and had\\n been outside the country for 14 days without showing symptoms would not\\n need to be further quarantined.   International students  contributed $34bn to the Australian economy  last year, and the sector faces major losses from students cancelling enrolments.   The travel ban has left nearly  100,000 Chinese    students \\n with valid visas stranded outside Australia, according to the latest \\nfigures from the Department of Home Affairs. Almost 59,000 Chinese \\ninternational students are in Australia.   As of Friday, there had been 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus across Australia, of which five people had recovered.   Many\\n universities have extended the deadline to enrol for the first \\nsemester, or to defer studies for a semester, or are offering online \\nclasses.   On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg,  told Radio National \\n there amight be opportunities for some of the universities to provide \\nquarantine for those Chinese students who are coming to Australiaa a but\\n did not mention regional campuses.   On Friday, the Go8 said it was implementing other measures to aminimise the disruption to studya.   Thompson\\n said where possible semester one programs could ajoin seamlesslya to \\nsemester two programs, especially for students close to completing their\\n degrees.   Monash University  has pushed back the start date of the semester by a week , while more than 4,000 students at the University of Sydney signed a petition to delay theirs by a fortnight.   The\\n University of Sydney said it had arranged temporary accommodation for \\nthe asmall number of students living in student accommodation that need \\nto self-isolatea.   Financial analysts Moodyas said on Friday that \\nthe financial hit of coronavirus and travel restrictions would be \\namanageablea if it was contained within the next few months.   But it noted that Australian universities were more dependent on international students from China than other OECD countries.   Among the Go8, 60% of international student enrolments are from China, and they represent 40% across all universities.   aIf\\n coronavirus is quickly contained a meaning within several months a the \\neffect on Australian universities is likely to be manageable, with \\nrevenue deferred (not lost) and no change to credit quality,a Moodyas \\nsaid.   aHowever, if the current outbreak is not contained quickly, \\nthe revenue effect and drawdown of cash reserves has the potential to be\\n significant.a   The co-secretary of the NSW branch of the National \\nTertiary Education Union, Michael Thomson, said academics and teachers \\nwere worried by universitiesa confusing responses to the ban.   aThere\\n is concern that university authorities are not being completely clear \\nabout what is happening,a he said. aPutting something back two weeks a \\ndoes that mean a 13-week semester becomes an 11-week semester?   aIn a sense the concern is the unknown. Itas almost like policy is being made on the hop.a   On\\n Friday, the NSW NTEU and the University of Sydneyas student \\nrepresentative council organised a protest against the travel ban.   SRC\\n president Liam Donohoe said earlier in the week the travel ban went \\nagainst the advice of the World Health Organisation and led to \\ninternational students alosing out on learning, work, relationships and \\ncommunitiesa to the extent that they amay never returna.

The number \\nof new infections in China\\'s Hubei province, the epicentre of the \\noutbreak, rose on Friday from a day earlier, Chinese health officials \\nsaid, reversing two days of declines and showing the difficulty of \\npredicting the epidemic\\'s peak.   The death toll in mainland China \\njumped by 86 to 722, and is poised to pass the 774 deaths recorded \\nglobally during the 2002-2003 pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory \\nSyndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that jumped from animals to humans \\nin China.   So far only two deaths have been reported outside \\nmainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines - from about 332 cases\\n in 27 countries and regions.   During the SARS outbreak between \\nNovember 2002 and July 2003, 774 people died globally, while the number \\nof reported cases was 8,098, suggesting a far lower transmission rate \\nthan the latest coronavirus, but a higher mortality rate.   After \\nChina recorded its first daily drop in the number of new infections on \\nThursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was too early say \\nwhether the outbreak had peaked.   The first cases in December were traced to a seafood market in the Hubei capital of Wuhan, where wildlife was sold illegally.   \"It\\n is hard to say how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is - that \\nis, what proportion of people with infection will eventually die of the \\ninfection,\" Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at \\nMonash University in Melbourne, told Reuters.   \"While the crude \\nmortality appears to be around 2%, there are likely to be many people \\nwho have been infected that haven\\'t been tested ... We probably won\\'t \\nknow the true case fatality for some time yet.\"   Hubei officials on\\n Saturday reported 81 new deaths, 67 of those in Wuhan, a city under \\nvirtual lockdown. Across mainland China, excluding the 2,050 people who \\nhad recovered and those who had died, the number of outstanding cases \\nstood at 31,774.   Beijing\\'s communist leadership has sealed off \\ncities, cancelled flights and closed factories to contain the epidemic, \\nwith ripple effects for global markets and businesses dependent on the \\nworld\\'s second-biggest economy.   WHO experts say they have not seen\\n the same rapid increase in cases in provinces outside Hubei, or in the \\nChinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau that were badly hit by SARS.   Speaking in Geneva, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned earlier that \"the numbers could go up again.\"   FALSE NEGATIVES   Not all of the infected will test positive for the virus, warned Wang Chen, head of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.   \"For\\n patients who are really infected with the new type of coronavirus, the \\npositive rate for tests is 30% to 50%,\" Wang told state television in an\\n interview that has gone viral on social media since its telecast on \\nWednesday.   \"There are still many false negatives by collecting \\nsuspected cases of throat swabs.

One image showed the message\\n \"farewell Li Wenliang\" etched into snow on a riverbank.   There \\nwere signs that discussion of Li\\'s death was being censored. After \\nbriefly trending on Weibo, the topics \"the Wuhan government owes doctor \\nLi Wenliang an apology\" and \"we want free speech\" yielded no search \\nresults.   LACK OF MASKS, GOWNS   The WHO chief warned of worldwide shortages of gowns, masks and other protective equipment.   \"When\\n supplies are short and demand is high, then there could be bad \\npractices like hoarding in order to sell them at higher prices, and \\nthat\\'s why we ask for solidarity,\" Tedros told a Geneva briefing.   Another\\n three people on a cruise liner off Japan tested positive for \\ncoronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship \\nto 64, Japan\\'s health ministry said on Saturday. Caribbean Cruises Ltd \\nRCL.N on Friday banned \"any guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau\\n passport, regardless of when they were there last\" from boarding the \\ncompany\\'s ships.   WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan said reports of \\nAsians being shunned in the West over a perceived connection to \\ncoronavirus was \"utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to \\nstop.\"   Taiwan\\'s government said that starting from Monday it would\\n suspend all direct passenger and freight shipping between the island \\nand China.

I hope you see what I saw: Ned Kelly is on fire . a In\\n or about the spring of 1870 the ground was very soft a hawker named Mr \\nGould got his wagon bogged between Greta and my motheras house on the \\neleven mile creek, the ground was that rotten it would bog a duck in \\nplaces.a   Why had no one told me about this? Had no one else seen what I saw, \\nthat the famous bushranger was an avant-garde artist with hardly a comma\\n to his name?   I was still drunk on Joyce, and mad with ignorant ambition.

While\\n the vast majority of cases have been in China, the virus has spread to \\nsome two dozen countries abroad, with the latest such cases including \\nfive British nationals infected in a French ski resort.   The \\nAmerican man died on Thursday in Wuhan, epicentre of the virus outbreak \\nin the central Chinese province of Hubei, a U.S. embassy spokesman said \\nin Beijing on Saturday.   \"We offer our sincerest condolences to the\\n family on their loss,\" he told Reuters. \"Out of the respect for the \\nfamily\\'s privacy, we have no further comment.\"   A Japanese man in \\nhis sixties and hospitalised with pneumonia in Wuhan also died after \\nsuffering symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus, Japan\\'s foreign \\nministry said.   The death toll in mainland China rose to 722 on \\nSaturday, according to authorities, and is poised to pass the 774 deaths\\n recorded globally during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute \\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS).   Most of the deaths in China have \\noccurred in and around Wuhan. Across mainland China, the number of cases\\n stood at 31,774 as of Saturday.   The virus has spread to 27 \\ncountries and regions, according to a Reuters count based on official \\nreports, infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported \\noutside of mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both \\nvictims were Chinese nationals.   The latest patients include five \\nBritish nationals staying in the same chalet at a ski resort in \\nHaute-Savoie in southeastern France, health officials said, raising \\nfears of further infections as British families head for the Alps during\\n the school half-term holidays.   The five had stayed in the same \\nski chalet with a person who had been in Singapore. They were not in a \\nserious condition, the officials said.   The Chinese economy will \\nsputter towards normal on Monday, as millions return from the provinces \\nto the big cities after the biggest holiday of the year. The holiday was\\n extended, but many workplaces will remain closed and many white-collar \\nworkers will continue to work from home.   U.S. electric carmaker Tesla\\'s factory in Shanghai will resume production on Monday, a government official said on Saturday.   Apple\\n Inc said it was working to reopen its China corporate offices and call \\ncentres and was making preparations to reopen retail stores there. But \\nChinese authorities have blocked a plan by Apple supplier Foxconn to \\nresume production from Feb. 10 over concerns about the spread of the \\nvirus, Japans Nikkei business daily reported on Saturday.   The \\nvirus has been a blow to China\\'s already-slowing economy, with Goldman \\nSachs cutting its first-quarter GDP growth target to 4% from 5.6% \\npreviously and saying a deeper hit is possible.   \"It\\'s certainly \\nnot going to be a return to normal next week,\" said Julian \\nEvans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in \\nSingapore.   \"The longer this disruption continues the higher the \\nrisk it affects employment and the higher the risk of a much bigger hit \\non the economy,\" he said.   \\'HARD TO SAY HOW LETHAL\\'   Health officials are still uncertain how deadly the illness is.   \"It\\n is hard to say how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is,\" \\nProfessor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at Monash \\nUniversity in Melbourne, told Reuters.   \"While the crude mortality \\nappears to be around 2%, there are likely to be many people who have \\nbeen infected that haven\\'t been tested ... We probably won\\'t know the \\ntrue case fatality for some time yet.\"   News of the death on Friday\\n of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was reprimanded by police for raising the \\nalarm about the new coronavirus, sparked outrage on Chinese social media\\n and rekindled memories of how Beijing was slow to tell the world about \\nthe SARS outbreak.   Beijing\\'s communist leadership has sealed off \\ncities, cancelled flights and closed factories to contain the epidemic, a\\n response that has had ripple effects globally for financial markets and\\n businesses dependent on the world\\'s second-biggest economy.   Chinese-ruled\\n Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people \\narriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous \\n14 days.   While China is bearing the brunt of the virus, anxiety is\\n increasing across Asia, with Japan alarmed by the rising number of \\ncases aboard a quarantined cruise ship, major foreign companies pulling \\nout of an international air show in Singapore, and Thailand losing money\\n as Chinese tourists stay home.   Another three people on the cruise\\n liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total \\nnumber of confirmed cases from the ship to 64, Japan\\'s health ministry \\nsaid.   Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd on Friday banned \"any guests \\nholding Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports, regardless of when they \\nwere there last\" from boarding the company\\'s ships.

Itas estimated that more \\nthan 60,000 sq km have been scorched in  New South Wales \\n and Victoria alone. Days of smoke have shrouded Sydney, Canberra and \\nMelbourne. And after the fires, flooding at the weekend in NSW and parts\\n of Queensland left thousands without power and dozens of schools closed\\n on Monday.   While the country is still grappling with the economic reality and \\nhuman devastation caused by the fires, itas easy to think the worst of \\nthis disaster is over. But unfortunately other extreme weather may yet \\noccur this summer and these will also require safety preparations and \\nrapid responses.   Last year was the driest and hottest year on record in Australia. \\nSome parts of the country have had several years of drought in a row. \\nBut all droughts end eventually. At the weekend devastating storms swept\\n through eastern NSW, causing flooding, power outages and commuter \\nchaos. The Bureau of Meteorology says 391.6mm of rain fell over Sydney \\nin the past four days, the most since 414.2mm fell from 2 to 5 February \\n1990.   Historically Australian continental-scale droughts are often broken \\nby widespread heavy rain, leading to an increased risk of flooding, \\nincluding potentially lethal flash floods. The flood risk from the heavy\\n rains is exacerbated by the bare soil and lack of vegetation caused by \\nthe drought and by bushfires that destroy forest and grassland. When a \\ndecade-long drought ended in 2009, what followed were two extremely wet \\nyears with serious flooding. Flooding also brings the risk that ash \\nmight contaminate water supplies. The heavy rain falling on bare soil \\ncan also lead to serious erosion.   The onset of the tropical wet season over northern Australia has been\\n very much delayed, as predicted in the middle of last year by the \\nBureau of Meteorology. Most of the Australian tropics have had well \\nbelow average rainfall in the past few months, and some areas had their \\nlowest November-January rainfall. As well, the tropical cyclone season \\nwas late, also predicted by the bureau months ago. In recent weeks there\\n has been some cyclone activity and some rain. But the wait is still on \\nfor widespread tropical rains and for more cyclones to cross the coast \\nas Damien did at the weekend. Although rain brought by cyclones are \\noften welcome, these systems can also leave serious damage.   We are at the riskiest time for heatwaves in southern Australia. The \\nrisk usually peaks around the middle to the end of summer. Weather \\nconducive to increased bushfire risk also usually peaks in February for \\nsouthern states. So although media, community and political attention \\nhave focused on the horrendous bushfires we have already suffered, we \\nshould not overlook the likelihood of other extreme weather, including \\ncyclones, floods and heatwaves, or think that the bushfire risk is over \\nfor the year. It is important to remain vigilant for all weather \\nextremes.   Although the fires have tragically claimed many lives, many others \\nhave been saved by the improved firefighting and warning systems, \\nsupported by improved weather and climate forecast systems to emergency \\nservices and the media by the Bureau of Meteorology.   Temperature forecasts five days ahead are better than one-day-ahead \\nforecasts were 50 years ago. Rainfall forecasts have also improved \\ndramatically. As well, scientific seasonal climate forecasts of rain, \\ndrought and seasonal cyclones a something not even dreamed of 50 years \\nago a are provided routinely by the bureau. These longer forecasts \\nallowed emergency services to better prepare for this horrible summer, \\nand the detailed shorter-range forecasts of weather conducive to fire \\nspread has helped fire agencies target warnings and provide resources to\\n threatened areas.   But one challenge as the summer continues will be the need for \\ncontinued communication between forecasters, emergency services and the \\npublic about predicted extreme weather. For some, awarning fatiguea may \\nset in and announcements of dangerous heatwaves or floods might be \\nignored. The warnings must continue to be disseminated to at-risk \\npopulations and local authorities must strive to ensure they are acted \\non. And meteorologists must keep up their efforts to improve forecasts \\non all timescales.   Global warming is already lengthening the fire season and making \\nheatwaves more intense, more frequent, and longer. It is also increasing\\n the likelihood of heavy rains and flash floods while simultaneously \\nmaking droughts worse in some areas. The occurrence of devastating \\nbushfires has been increasing in the past few decades, despite better \\nforecasts and improved firefighting technology and organisation. The \\nintrinsic link between these weather extremes and climate change means \\nwe need to address the wider issue: what can we do to slow the rate of \\nglobal warming.   Australians pride themselves on winning against the odds and adapting\\n to extreme weather. How often have you heard a politician say Australia\\n has always been a land of droughts and flooding rains, or that we have \\nalways had heatwaves and bushfires? Australian rainfall is indeed more \\nvariable than most parts of the world, so the reality is that we do face\\n extreme weather, year after year.   But another reality is that daytime temperatures across Australia \\nhave increased by more than a degree just in the past 25 years. In the \\n1990s on average about 5% of the country each year had annual average \\ndaytime temperatures in the hottest 10% of historical temperatures. But \\nover the past five years, on average, more than  half  the \\ncountry has experienced such hot temperatures each year. From 5% to over\\n 50% in the lifetime of generation Z. Such strong warming must affect \\nnot just all the weather extremes a droughts, floods, heatwaves, \\nbushfires, cyclones and storms a but also their impacts on humans, \\nanimals and the bush.   And there is no reason to expect this warming to slow without \\nconcerted political action. So we need an increased focus on how to deal\\n with these amplified risks from climate and weather extremes a how to \\nadapt a at the same time that our politicians lead global action to slow\\n the rate of warming. We donat have much time. We need to adapt, to \\nmanage the unavoidable, and slow greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the \\nunmanageable.    aC/  Neville Nicholls is an emeritus professor at Monash \\nUniversity.

Mr\\n Widodo also used his address to call for greater ties between \\nIndonesian and Australia youth, who he praised as the \"leaders of \\ntomorrow\".   Labor leader Anthony Albanese presented Mr Widodo with\\n a colourful mosaic bowl from bushfire-ravaged Mogo on the NSW south \\ncoast.   Mr Albanese said the gift was to remind Mr Widodo of his \\nnation\\'s support to communities struggling after bushfires, with \\nIndonesian military, engineers and medical staff helping with relief \\nefforts.   The trade agreement, passed by the Indonesian parliament last week, is aimed at boosting multi-billion dollar ties.   Australia will open Indonesia\\'s first foreign university campus and consider watering down its travel warnings.   But Prime Minister Scott Morrison says challenges around terrorism, foreign fighters and influence are still front of mind.   Mr\\n Morrison announced Monash University would set up Indonesia\\'s first \\nforeign campus - a move he described as \"a very good example of how this\\n is a two-way street\".   The deal was made possible after the \\nIndonesian government finalised regulations allowing foreign \\nuniversities as part of a push to improve the country\\'s higher education\\n performance.   Mr Morrison also detailed plans to make travel easier between the countries.   Australia\\'s travel advisory level for Indonesia is at level two: \"exercise a high degree of caution\".   Indonesia is one of the world\\'s fastest growing economies.   Trade\\n Minister Simon Birmingham said the agreement would be a major boost for\\n Australian farmers through lower tariffs and improved access.   Indonesian\\n goods will be subject to zero tariffs when entering Australia, while \\ntariffs on 94 per cent of Australian goods imported to Indonesia will be\\n eliminated gradually.   Indonesia and Australia already enjoy bilateral trade worth $17.8 billion.

President Joko Widodo was addressing a rare joint-sitting of the \\nAustralian Parliament during the first visit to the country by \\nIndonesian leader since Susilo Bambang Yuhhoyono in 2010.   Indonesian and Australian officials had earlier signed documents \\nsupporting bilateral free trade that deepens wide-ranging links between \\nthe near-neighbors, as the Australian government attempts to reduce its \\nheavy economic reliance on China.   Widodo said his country of 270 million people was forecast to become \\nthe worlda s fourth-largest economy by 2050 with the worldas \\nthird-largest middle class.   The world could also face more uncertainties by then with greater challenges to geopolitics and geoeconomics, Widodo said.   aStagnation of economic growth and even the recession of the economy \\nare looming large and it is feared that the values of democracy and \\ndiversity are becoming more marginalized,a Widodo said through an \\ninterpreter.   aIn the midst of the enormous challenges, Indonesia and Australia must focus on strengthening the partnership,a he added.   Indonesia is Australiaas closest neighbor after Papua New Guinea. But\\n the two countries rank as only each otheras 13th most important partner\\n in terms of bilateral trade.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who underscored the importance of the \\nbilateral relationship by making Jakarta the destination of his first \\noverseas trip as national leader in 2018, described Indonesia as aone of\\n the star economies of the world over the next 10 to 20 years.a   Morrison said the multifaceted free trade deal which will take effect\\n early this year would be mutually beneficial for both countries.   Monash University, Australiaas largest, will open its first overseas campus in Indonesia under the agreement.   Widodo said he hoped Australia would become an important partner in infrastructure investment as well as education.   The Australian and Indonesian leaders emphasized the closeness of \\ntheir relationship by sharing an informal dinner at the prime ministeras\\n residence on Saturday with their foreign ministers but no other \\nofficials.   Morrison said Governor-General David Hurley had taken the two leaders\\n on a aroo toura on Saturday a a golf buggy trip around the grounds of \\nGovernment House to see the many kangaroos.   Morrison thanked Indonesia for sending army engineers and emergency \\ncrews to help rebuild after recent wildfires. They are now responding to\\n widespread flooding in southeast Australia.   Widodo only used English during his speech to Parliament to say: aA friend in need is a friend indeeda and: aGood day, mate.a  ', ' Indonesian President Joko Widodo says the long-delayed \\nfree-trade agreement with Australia will lead to improved relations with\\n its neighbor, with education and services a key focus of the deal.   aThis\\n means in the next five years our bilateral relations will better \\ndirected,a Jokowi, as Widodo is commonly known, told reporters in \\nCanberra on Monday. aGoing forward, economic relations between the two \\ncountries will grow and bring more tangible benefits for the people.a       Joko Widodo with Scott Morrison in Canberra on Feb. 10.   Photographer: Mark Graham/Bloomberg   Indonesiaas\\n often-strained relations with Australia are on the upswing, and on \\nMonday Jokowi became the first Indonesian leader to address Australiaas \\nparliament since Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2010. The deal, which has \\nnow been ratified by both nations and is expected to be enforced \\nimminently, was inked 10 months ago after more than eight years of \\nnegotiations and 11th-hour delays, underlining the sometimes terse ties \\nbetween the two countries.   The visit has been heavily focused on the nationsa economic \\nrelationship, viewed as underdeveloped considering their geographical \\nproximity. A series on diplomatic tensions and scandals have hindered \\nties between Australia and Southeast Asiaas biggest economy, which is \\nalso the worldas largest Muslim-majority country.   Along\\n with completing the free-trade agreement, which Trade Minister Simon \\nBirmingham expects will be implemented by May, Australia has also agreed\\n to look at simplifying visa entry for Indonesians, while it was \\nannounced Melbourneas Monash University will become the first Australian\\n campus to open in the country.   The nations also agreed to establish an aenergy dialogue,a \\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters, ensuring the afuel sources\\n for the future are very much part of Indonesiaas development and \\nAustraliaas.a   Two-way trade and investment between the nations is \\nrelatively small and significantly lags other nations in the region, \\nincluding Singapore ( $30.4 billion ) and Malaysia ( $16.7 billion ). It was worth  $7.8 billion  last year, down from the  $10.5 billion \\n recorded in 2014, according to Indonesian Trade Ministry data. Over \\nthat same period, Australiaas trade surplus with Indonesia has steadily \\ngrown from  $700 million  to  $3.2 billion .   The deal will see more than 99% of Australian goods exports \\nto Indonesia enter duty free or under significantly improved and \\npreferential arrangements, while Australia will immediately eliminate \\nall remaining tariffs on imports from Indonesia.   While Australiaas agriculture exports, including wheat, live animals and sugar, were valued at A $2.8 billion  in 2018, services including education led the way, with two-way trade valued at A $5.8 billion  that year.   The deal \\n will allow Australian-owned companies to invest in more Indonesian \\nassets, supply mining and energy-related services, and operate railway \\nin road transport infrastructure.   The deal paves the way for Indonesia to boost exports of \\npetroleum, furniture, wood products and footwear. It opens the door for \\nAustraliaas education sector in Indonesia, something that pleases Jokowi\\n as he looks to up-skill a labor force the size of the combined \\npopulations of Germany and South Korea. Of the 127 million Indonesians \\nwith jobs, less than 10% have a university degree.   Jokowi also \\nsees the deal as an opportunity to address the countryas overall trade \\nshortfall and current account deficit. Indonesia posted a trade deficit \\nof  $3.2 billion  last year, after recording a record  $8.6 billion \\n shortfall in 2018, while the central bank says the current account \\ndeficit narrowed to about 2.7% of gross domestic product last year.   The\\n relationship has been tested many times, from revelations Australia \\nattempted to tap the phone of Yudhoyonoas wife to issues over \\nasylum-seeker boats, and the live cattle trade. More recently, Morrison \\ncaused a diplomatic row when he suggested Australia could formally \\nrecognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move its embassy there.   Morrison\\n said the two nations will seek to increase cooperation on maritime \\nsecurity, as Indonesia shares aour commitment to sovereignty, stability \\nand respect for the rule of international lawa in the South China Sea.

Six promising immune \\nbiomarkers alone, or in combination with conventional tests, were \\nsubsequently analysed in an independent validation cohort (na=a69). IL-6\\n was identified as the main driver of variability followed closely by \\nconventional diagnostic tests. Median sera IL-6 was higher in HGSOC \\npatients compared to those with a benign mass or controls with normal \\novaries (28.3 vs 7.3 vs 1.2apg/ml, pa&lt;a0.0001). The combination of \\nIL-6 further improved the overall predictive probability of the \\nconventional tests. Modelling a two-step triage of women with a \\nsuspicious ovarian mass, with IL-6a&gt;a3.75apg/ml as primary triage \\nfollowed by conventional tests (CA125 or RMI score) identified ovarian \\ncancer in patients with a misclassification rate of 4.54a3.03%, superior\\n to the use of CA125 or RMI alone (9.09 to 10.60). The validation cohort\\n demonstrated a similar improvement in the diagnostic sensitivity \\nfollowing addition of IL-6. IL-6 in combination with conventional tests \\nmay be a useful clinical biomarker for triage of patients with a \\nsuspected malignant ovarian mass.   Epithelial\\n ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. \\nHigh-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most aggressive \\nsubtype and generally presents at an advanced stage  1  . Although the 5-year survival rate increased significantly from 36% in 1986a1990 to 46% in 2011a2015  2  ,\\n the prognosis for women with advanced ovarian cancer remains poor due \\nto its late presentation and the lack of scientifically validated \\nscreening tools  2 , 3  .\\n Optimal surgical cytoreduction as part of a multidisciplinary team, \\nremains an important prognostic factor in ovarian cancer management and \\nsurvival  4  .\\n Pre-operative discrimination of ovarian carcinoma from non-malignant \\npelvic masses is crucial to ensure correct diagnosis and prompt referral\\n to a specialist center, and subsequent optimization of primary \\ntreatment to improve survival.   A definitive predictive biomarker \\nhas not yet been identified. Standard investigation tools for adnexal \\nmasses currently in place are clinical examination, assays of tumour \\nmarkers and ultrasound assessment. None of these tools is very sensitive\\n or specific for predicting malignancy when considered separately.   Serum\\n CA125, a glycoprotein antigen, is found at elevated levels in 1% of \\nhealthy individuals, 6% of patients with benign ovarian mass, as well as\\n other malignancies  5   and physiological states, including pregnancy, endometriosis and menstruation  6  .\\n Serum CA125 levels are raised above 35aU/mL in 78% of women with \\nmalignant ovarian mass, but also in 22% of women with benign masses  7  .\\n Therefore, serum CA125, when used alone, is not highly reliable in \\ndifferentiating patients with malignant compared to benign masses  8  . In a review by Jacobs and Bast  et. al ,\\n while only about 50% of patients with stage I epithelial ovarian cancer\\n had elevated levels of CA125, highest levels were seen in more than 90%\\n of women with advanced stages  6  .\\n CA-125 has greater sensitivity and specificity in postmenopausal women \\nthan in those who are premenopausal. In a study by Grzybowski W  et. al ,\\n the sensitivity and specificity of CA125 among postmenopausal women \\nwith ovarian cancer were higher at 88.7% and 98.07% respectively, while \\nin the premenopausal cohort sensitivity was only 64.0% and specificity \\n94.1%  9  .   The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI), an algorithm developed by Jacobs  et al . in 1990  10  ,\\n is the most widely used risk assessment for ovarian malignancy and is \\nvaluable for selective referral to a specialist center. RMI (at a \\nthreshold of &gt;200) has an improved sensitivity of 87% and specificity\\n of 97% for ovarian cancer  11  \\n compared to CA125 alone. The RMI score is generated by a simplified \\nregression equation of serum CA125 level, menopausal status scores and \\nultrasound feature scores (RMIa=aultrasound findings x menopause status x\\n CA125 U/ml)  10  .\\n RMI stratifies patients into high or low risk based on a numerical \\nscore, with RMI &gt;200 considered as high risk, with a likelihood of \\nhaving a malignant tumour of 75%  12  ,\\n therefore requiring urgent assessment by a gynaecological oncologist to\\n ensure optimal treatment outcome. Although the RMI score is highly \\nsensitive and specific, it requires ultrasound imaging scoring  13  .\\n In facilities with no ultrasound readily available, RMI scoring is \\nunderutilized to predict malignancy pre-operatively, and in facilities \\nwith multiple imaging modalities, the lack of standardization across \\nimaging methods, and dependence on subjective operator assessment can \\nhighly influence the variability in RMI scores  13  .   Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) is a relatively new serum biomarker for the detection of ovarian cancer  14 , 15  . HE4, a transcript of WFDC2 gene on chromosome 20  16  ,\\n was originally found to be expressed in human epididymis. HE4 is also \\nexpressed in normal tissues including respiratory and reproductive tract  17  . The overexpression of HE4 gene in ovarian cancer was discovered in 1999 by Shummer  et al .  18  . In 2003, HE4 was reported as a promising serum biomarker for detection of ovarian cancer  19  .\\n A meta-analysis of nine studies involving 1807 women reported that the \\npooled sensitivity and specificity for HE4 in diagnosing ovarian cancer \\nwere 83% and 90% respectively with a summarized ROC curve of 0.9271  20  .\\n HE4 alone performed similarly when the ROC curve was compared with \\nCA125, except CA125 performed better among postmenopausal women, while \\nHE4 correlated inversely with age  15 , 21  . HE4 emerged as a potential lead biomarker out of nine analytes tested by Moore  et al .  21  ,\\n who proposed it to be incorporated with CA125 and menopausal status \\ninto an algorithm to predict ovarian cancer. An alternative risk of \\nmalignancy algorithm (ROMA) combines CA125 and HE4 values along with the\\n menopausal status into a predictive index, which in turn is used to \\ncalculate the predicted probability of ovarian cancer (from 0 to 100%). \\nThis has been shown to successfully stratify patients into high and low \\nrisk groups with 93.8% of ovarian cancer correctly classified as high \\nrisk  22  .\\n The disadvantage of this algorithm is the use of HE4 which is an \\nexpensive test and is not readily available in low- or middle-income \\ncountries.   Components of the inflammatory and immunosuppressive \\npathway including systemic cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-a, IL-10, \\nTGF- I2 ) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CXCL10) in the ovarian cancer \\nmicroenvironment have been shown to contribute to the development of \\ncarcinogenesis  23 , 24 , 25  .\\n Cytokines and chemokines are cell signaling molecules that are \\nessential to help cell to cell communication in the regulation of \\nimmunity, inflammation and hematopoiesis  23  .   We\\n hypothesized that inclusion of inflammatory or immunosuppressive \\nbiomarkers present in serum or plasma may enhance or complement the \\nidentification of malignancy in patients with HGSOC, above current \\ndiagnostic methods including CA125, RMI, HE4 and ROMA.   This\\n study is a part of the Immunity and Ovarian Cancer trial (Project \\n13/32) and has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee \\n(HREC) of the Royal Womenas Hospital, Melbourne. The clinical research \\nstudy was carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and \\nregulations. A total of 80 women undergoing ovarian removal surgery and \\nwho fulfilled the study inclusion criteria (Table\\xa0 1 ) were initially recruited following signed written informed consent. Following the strict exclusion study criteria (Table\\xa0 1 ),\\n fourteen women were excluded from the study. The reasons for exclusion \\nwere significant concomitant heart, liver and vascular disease (na=a3), \\ntaking immunosuppressive drugs (na=a4) and having a concomitant active \\ncancer such as breast and colorectal cancer (na=a3) as well as an \\novarian cancer other than high-grade serous type (na=a4). Sixty-six \\nwomen were finally enrolled and constituted the final sample for the \\ntraining phase of the study. Thirty-three women had newly diagnosed \\nHGSOC, 12 women had benign ovarian masses and the control group \\nconsisted of 21 women undergoing risk reduction surgery for a known \\ngenetic mutation (e.g. BRCA or Lynch syndrome) or a strong family \\nhistory of ovarian and/or breast cancers.   All relevant clinical \\ninformation including age, self-reported menopausal status, pre-existing\\n medical conditions and drug history, and any prior history of \\nmalignancy were obtained from de-identified patient medical records. \\nVenous blood samples were obtained from patients prior to any surgical \\nor chemotherapy treatment. Baseline blood components, serum CA125 levels\\n and pelvic ultrasound reports were collected for all patients. \\nFollowing surgery, relevant documentation on final diagnosis, surgical \\nstaging findings and a thorough histological assessment of tumour type, \\nstage and grade following multidisciplinary team consensus were \\nobtained. Patientas tumours were staged according to the criteria of the\\n International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). Patient \\ndetails immediately relevant to this study are provided in Table\\xa0 2 .   The\\n validation phase consisted of clinical samples obtained through the \\nOCRF-sponsored Ovarian Cancer Tissue Banking program located at the \\nHudson Institute, Australia. Ethical approval was obtained from the \\nEpworth Human Research Ethics Committee EH2016-165. The clinical \\nresearch study was carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines \\nand regulations. All participants provided prior informed written \\nconsent. A total of 50 women undergoing surgery for a suspected ovarian \\nmass during the period 2014a2016 were included in the study. For \\nindependent sub-analysis, we also obtained blood from ten women with \\nhistologically confirmed endometriosis. We also recruited 19 healthy \\nvolunteers at the Royal Women Hospital and Monash University, Australia \\nfollowing informed written consent and ethical approval from the \\ninstitutionas research board.   The validation phase cohorts were \\nnot pre-selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria that were\\n used in the training phase study. Therefore, 7 out of 25 patients with \\nHGSOC and 5 out 25 women with benign ovarian masses had complex medical \\nco-morbidities such as major cardiovascular diseases, complicated or \\nuncontrolled medical conditions, active autoimmune disease as well \\nimmune suppressing medications (Supplementary Table\\xa0 1 ).\\n All relevant clinical information, including age, self-reported \\nmenopausal status, pre-existing conditions or medications, any prior \\nhistory of malignancy, comprehensive histological assessment of tumour \\ntype, stage and grade by qualified gynaecological oncologists were \\nobtained from de-identified patient medical records. Venous blood \\nsamples were obtained from anaesthetized patients prior to any surgical \\nor chemotherapy treatment. Measurement of serum CA125 for all study \\npatients was performed in the diagnostic pathology laboratory, either at\\n the Monash Medical Centre or Royal Women Hospital, Melbourne, \\nAustralia.   Serum and \\nplasma were isolated from whole blood collected either in serum \\nseparation tubes (primary cohort) or EDTA-coated tubes (validation \\nstudy) by centrifugation at 3000arpm for 10aminutes. All blood samples \\nwere separated within less than 3ahours of being obtained. After \\nremoving cellular and protein debris, serum/plasma was aliquoted and \\nstored at a80aAdegC until later use. Blood parameters i.e. hemoglobin (Hb),\\n platelet count (PLT), white cell count (WCC), absolute neutrophil count\\n (ANC), total lymphocyte count (TLC) and serum CA125 were routinely \\ndetermined in all patients suspected of ovarian cancer and prior to \\nsurgery.   Multiplex\\n magnetic bead immunoassay kits were used as per manufactureras protocol\\n (Invitrogen) to simultaneously measure 28 numerous analytes in a single\\n sample. Human 25-Plex panel was used to determine quantitative \\nmeasurement of cytokines (GM-CSF, IFN-I+-, IFN-I3, IL-1I2, IL-1RA, IL-2, \\nIL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p40/p70), IL-13, \\nIL-15, IL-17 and TNF-I+-) and chemokines (RANTES, Eotaxin, CCL2/MCP-1, \\nCCL3/MIP-1alpha, CCL4/ MIP-1beta, CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10) in study \\nserum. This 25-Plex panel was combined with singleplex cytokine beads \\nsTNFRII and CCL22/MDC purchased separately. TGF-I2 was analysed \\nseparately using a singleplex bead kit. HE4 was assayed using R&amp;D \\nhuman pre-mixed magnetic Luminex assay kit.   For\\n the validation study, a 6-panel kit consisting of IFN-I3, IL-1RA, IL-6, \\nIL-10, TNF-I+-, sTNFRII was used and TGF-I2 and HE4 were assayed as a \\nsingleplex kit.   Both the training and validation phases were \\nanalysed using the same assay protocol. Prior to analysis, serum samples\\n were completely thawed, clarified by centrifugation (1000ag for \\n10amins) and filtered to prevent clogging of the filter plates. Serum \\nsamples for TGF-I2 assay required acid-treatment and neutralization to \\nremove latency associated peptide from TGF-I21 prior to use in assay. The\\n serum samples were randomly assigned to the plates to avoid assay bias \\nand were analysed in duplicates to determine inter-assay differences. A \\nfilter-bottom, 96-well microplate was coated with 25aI 1/4 l antibody-coated \\nbeads. A standard curve was made by serially diluting the human cytokine\\n standard cocktail in assay diluent. Standards were pipetted at 100aI 1/4 l \\nper well in duplicates, while patient sera were pipetted at 50aI 1/4 l per \\nwell in duplicates. 50aI 1/4 l of assay diluent was added to the standards \\nand patient samples, and 50aI 1/4 l of incubation buffer was added to all \\nwells. The plates were incubated for 2ahours at room temperature on an \\norbital shaker at 500a600arpm in the dark at room temperature. Wells \\nwere washed twice using a magnetic separator. A cocktail of biotinylated\\n secondary antibodies was added, and the microplate was incubated for an\\n hour in the dark on a microtiter shaker. Following twice washing with \\nmagnetic separator, streptavidin-phytoerythrin was added and incubated \\nunder agitation for 30aminutes in the dark at room temperature. The \\nplate was washed for three times and 100aI 1/4 l of wash solution was added \\nto each well and the samples were analysed using LuminexA(r) 200TM analyser\\n (Luminex Corp) as per standard protocol. For each analyte, 100 beads \\nwere analysed and the median fluorescence intensity was determined. \\nAnalysis of median fluorescence intensities was performed using \\nfive-parameter logistic curve fitting to the standard analyte values. \\nThe inter-assay variability of each assay was 2% to 8% and the \\nintra-assay variability was 2% to 7%.   The\\n RMI (Risk of Malignancy index) score was calculated based on menopausal\\n status (M), serum CA125 concentration and ultrasound scores (U) for all\\n patients. The equation used:    $$RMI={Ux}\\\\,{Mx}\\\\,{CA125}\\\\,{concentration}\\\\,{in}\\\\,{plasma}\\\\,{or}\\\\,{serum}$$    where:\\n M-menopausal status-(1a=apremenopausal, 3a=apostmenopausal), \\nU-ultrasound scores- features include bilateral mass, presence of solid \\nareas, multi-loculated cyst, intra-abdominal metastases and ascites  10  .

The validation exercise was conducted by using the \\nsplitting rules associated with the classification trees that were \\nderived from the training phase, to classify patients in the validation \\ndata set and to thereby form predictions of their status. These \\npredictions of the status of the patients were then compared to the \\nactual status of the patients in 3aAa3 contingency tables and Somersa D \\nstatistic was used to assess the agreement between predicted and actual \\nstatus.   Graphpad Prism version 8.3.0 and SPSS IBM 23.0 were used \\nfor analyses of PCA, ROC curve and logistic regressions. GenStat \\n(Version 17.1) was used for analyses of variance and estimation of \\ncontrasts of means. The R programming language (Version 3.3.2) was used \\nto create the volcano plot, the rpart library was used to construct \\nclassification trees with minimum node size set to 10. The rattle \\nlibrary was used to draw the resulting trees. The SAS package (Version \\n9.4) was used to calculate Somersa D.   All\\n patients with ovarian cancer had Stage III-IV high-grade serous \\nadenocarcinoma (na=a33) and the majority of patients with a benign \\novarian mass (na=a12) had a serous cystadenoma (75%). No ovarian \\npathology was found in the patients undergoing risk reduction surgery \\nfor a genetic mutation or family history of hereditary breast or ovarian\\n cancer (na=a21). The median age of patients with ovarian cancer and \\nthose with benign ovaries were 60 and 55 years respectively, while the \\nmedian age for patients with normal ovaries was younger at 48 \\n(Table\\xa0 2 ).\\n There was no significant difference in the haemoglobin, platelet and \\nwhite cell count and absolute neutrophil count level between the three \\ngroups of patients. The mean of total lymphocytes was significantly \\nlower in ovarian cancer patients compared with those with benign ovarian\\n mass (Table\\xa0 2 ) and normal ovaries.   Figure\\xa0 1 \\n summarizes all 28 immune soluble factor concentrations measured using \\nmultiplex bead immunoassay analysed using one-way analyses of variances.\\n The pair-wise t-tests and contrast of means between the three groups \\n(malignant, benign and normal ovaries) were calculated for each immune \\nsoluble factor and summarized in the volcano plot analysis (Fig.\\xa0 1 ).\\n Immune factors IL-6 and IL8 in the pre-operative sera emerged as the \\nonly two cytokines with greater than a 2-fold change. Serum IL8 \\nconcentrations were more than 2-fold different between patients with \\nmalignant and normal ovaries as well as between benign and normal \\novaries (pa&lt;a0.05). Serum IL8 concentrations were not statistically \\ndifferent between patients with malignant and benign ovarian masses. \\nPre-operative IL-6 concentrations differences were greater than 2-fold \\nin all three groups: malignant versus benign, benign vs normal and \\nmalignant versus normal ovaries (pa&lt;a0.05) (Fig.\\xa0 1 ).   All\\n collected blood factors and clinical parameters were further included \\nin a PCA analysis. Given the age difference between patients with \\nmalignancy and normal ovaries, age as well as menopausal status were \\nfurther incorporated as factors in the PCA. Four components with \\neigenvalues above one were extracted, indicating that they were the main\\n contributors to the variability of the samples. Component 1 represented\\n 15.8% of total variances of the study groups. Component 1 included the \\nconventional diagnostic tools and biomarkers, RMI score, ROMA, HE4 and \\nCA125, as well as the immune factors IL-6 and IL8 (Supplementary \\nFig.\\xa0 1 ).   These\\n six factors were individually assessed for their ability to distinguish\\n between the three groups of patients using Kruskal-Wallis analysis, \\nfollowed by Dunnas multiple comparison test (Fig.\\xa0 2 ).\\n The median of RMI score in patients with HGSOC was significantly higher\\n compared to those with benign ovarian masses and normal ovaries (3204 \\nvs 151 vs 10 IU/mL, pa=a0.001). Similarly, the mean of ROMA in patients \\nwith HGSOC was also significantly higher percentage at 88.4aA+-a12.4% \\nmedian 89.3, range: 33.6a99.7%) compared to those with benign ovaries \\n(19.9aA+-a13.4, median 23.78%) and normal ovaries (3.33%).   The \\npatients with ovarian cancer had a higher mean of serum CA125 level \\n(1125aA+-a2270, median 372, range: 29a10430 IU/mL) compared to those with \\nbenign masses (47.8aA+-a55.1, median:26, range: 5a177 IU/mL) and normal \\novaries (15.1aA+-a29.9, median 8.0, range 5a145), adjusted pa=a0.0002 and \\n0.0001 respectively. The serum levels of CA125 were not able to \\ndiscriminate between those with benign and normal ovaries, (adjusted p \\nvalue following Dunnas post-hoc test was 0.60). Although the median of \\nCA125 levels among those in benign group was observed to be twice as \\nhigh as those with normal ovaries, the adjusted p value was not \\nsignificant at 0.60. This may be largely attributed to the small sample \\nsize of the benign group.   The mean HE4 level in patients with \\nHGSOC was significantly higher (583aA+-a589, median 357.4, range: \\n22.4a2060 pM) compared to those with benign ovaries (54.3aA+-a23.5, median\\n 50.6, range: 29.3a99.3 pM) and normal ovarian mass (38.4aA+-a16.3, median\\n 35.7, range: 18.9a81.3 pM). Following Kruskal-Wallis analysis and \\nmultiple comparisons with Dunnas test, serum HE4 was able to \\ndiscriminate ovarian cancer from those with benign masses, as well with \\nnormal ovaries. Similar to CA125, the level of HE4 was not able to \\ndiscriminate between benign and normal ovaries with adjusted p value of \\n0.84.   The median level of IL-6 was higher in patients with HGSOC \\ncompared to benign ovarian masses or normal ovaries (28.3 vs 7.4 vs \\n1.2apg/ml, pa=a0.0001) (Fig.\\xa0 2 ).\\n Using multiplex magnetic bead immunoassay kits, the level of 28 \\nanalytes, including IL6 was measured. We found that the level of IL-6 \\nwas below the level of detection in the serum of 28.5% (6/21) patients \\nwith normal ovaries in this study, while 6.7% (1/15) of patients with a \\nbenign ovarian mass and no patients with Stage III-IV HGSOC had an \\nundetectable level. The majority of patients (97%) with Stage III-IV \\nHGSOC had elevated IL-6 with a mean concentration of 40.4aA+-a40.6, range:\\n 5.6a215.88apg/ml compared to those with benign masses (6.8aA+-a3.0, \\nrange: 0.5a10.73apg/ml and normal ovaries (1.3aA+-a0.7, range \\n0.5a2.8apg/ml), which was statistically significant following \\nKruskal-Wallis and Dunnas post-hoc analysis (Fig.\\xa0 2 ).\\n Therefore, IL-6 by itself could distinguish between the three study \\npatient groups. A total of eighteen out of 33 (54.5%) patients had \\nascites in the training cohort. Significantly higher IL-6 levels were \\ndetected in patientsa ascites (median, 18,050apg/ml [range: 5162 to \\n122,883apg/ml]) compared with serum (median, 53apg/ml [range: 11.2 to \\n216apg/ml]) (pa=a0.0001). The presence of ascites did not correlate with\\n higher levels of serum IL6 (pa=a0.09).   The mean serum IL8 \\nconcentration in patients with ovarian cancer (3124aA+-a7336, median \\n320.5, range: 48.6a37574apg/ml) were significantly higher when compared \\nto healthy controls (262.4aA+-a368.6, median 165.7, range: 23.7a1694 \\npg/ml, pa=a0.02). Serum IL8 was not able to distinguish between benign \\nand malignant ovarian masses as elevated concentrations of IL8 were also\\n observed in benign masses (1961aA+-a2400, median 1363, range: \\n21.8a7965apg/ml), pa=a0.07. Although the median of IL8 levels among \\nthose in benign group is observed to be 1.5 times higher than those with\\n normal ovaries, the adjusted p value following Dunnas post-hoc test was\\n not significant. This may be largely attributed by the small sample \\nsize of the benign group. None of the other factors analysed could \\ndistinguish between the three study groups.   As RMI score and ROMA \\nare the current diagnostic tests used in the prediction of malignancy to\\n facilitate referral to specialized center, ROC (Receiver operator \\ncharacteristic) analysis which combines the strengths of sensitivity and\\n specificity was performed to calculate the area under curve (AUC), \\nwhich summarizes overall test performance  28   (Fig.\\xa0 3 ).\\n The value of AUC was used to evaluate the performance of selected \\nfactors for the ability to discriminate between the groups (malignant vs\\n benign, malignant vs normal and benign vs normal). The value closer to \\none indicates better discriminatory test performance, while AUCa=a0.50 \\nwould suggest predictive accuracy equivalent to that of chance alone  29  .\\n IL8 had an AUC value of 0.743 (95% CI 0.618a0.868), which show \\nacceptable predictive ability to discriminate malignant and \\nnon-malignant patients but was not superior or comparable to AUC value \\nof CA125 (0.986), HE4 (0.997), RMI score (0.987) or ROMA (0.998) \\n(Fig.\\xa0 3 ).\\n By contrast IL-6 showed excellent predictive value in distinguishing \\nbetween malignant and non-malignant patients (AUC 0.976, 95% CI \\n0.948a1.000), comparable to the AUC value for conventional tests (RMI \\nand ROMA) and biomarkers (CA125 and HE4) (Fig.\\xa0 3A ).\\n The AUC value was also calculated for all immune factors and \\nconventional tests between the three study groups: HGSOC vs benign \\novarian mass, malignant vs normal ovaries and those with benign ovarian \\nmass vs normal ovaries (Table\\xa0 4 ).\\n IL-6 alone (AUC 0.927) had a good predictive AUC value, similar but not\\n superior to conventional tests and biomarkers to distinguish between \\nmalignant and benign ovarian patients (Table\\xa0 3 ).\\n The predictive ability of IL-6 was excellent (AUC 1.000) when it came \\nto be discriminating between those with malignant and normal ovaries \\n(Table\\xa0 3 ).\\n Furthermore, IL-6 (AUC 0.905) was superior to CA125 (AUC 0.73), HE4 \\n(AUC 0.84) or ROMA (AUC 0.84) in distinguishing between patients with a \\nbenign ovarian mass and normal ovaries (Table\\xa0 4 ).\\n Moreover, the combination of IL-6 with existing conventional diagnostic\\n tools such as RMI score and ROMA or conventional biomarkers CA125 and \\nHE4 improved the ability of the tests to identify patients with \\nmalignant ovaries (Table\\xa0 3 , Figs.\\xa0 3 , 4 ).   To\\n evaluate the useful thresholds for combining IL-6 and conventional \\ntests to discriminate disease status (normal, benign or malignant), \\nclassification and regression trees (CART) were fitted to the data in \\nthe training phase using recursive partitioning method. The analyses \\nidentified a serum concentration of IL-6 of less than 3.75apg/ml as \\ninformative for use as initial triage to identify patients with normal \\novaries. In the three trees (Fig.\\xa0 5AaC )\\n selected for further investigation, 21/21 normal patients were \\ncorrectly assigned to the anormala group at this threshold. In a second \\nstage of the CART analyses, IL-6 was evaluated in trees in combination \\nwith either CA125, RMI index or ROMA index. IL-6 at less than 3.75apg/ml\\n correctly identified all patients with normal ovaries as normal in all \\ntrees (Fig.\\xa0 5AaC ).\\n Inclusion of CA125 or RMI (at the thresholds resulting from CART \\nanalysis of the same dataset), into the IL-6-tree resulted in a decrease\\n in the misclassification rate of CA125 or RMI alone (Table\\xa0 4 ).\\n Incorporating HE4 and ROMA into the IL-6-tree also improved the \\naccuracy of discrimination of malignant disease, with the highest \\naccuracy and zero misclassification rate seen in the combination of HE4 \\nand IL-6, and/or CA125 (Table\\xa0 4 ).\\n This system may offer therefore a more robust classification, with \\nimproved accuracy and lowered misclassification rates than observed for \\ncurrent methods as a result of the inclusion of IL-6 as demonstrated in \\nthis study (Table\\xa0 4 ).   To\\n evaluate the usefulness of the three IL-6-based classification, plasma \\nsamples from an independent cohort, including 25 patients with advanced \\nstage high grade serous ovarian cancer, 25 patients with a benign \\novarian mass and 19 healthy volunteers, were tested. The pre-treatment \\nsamples from this cohort were collected prospectively from 2014 and \\nstored in a biobank till date of assay. The demographic characteristics \\nof the second cohort are summarized in Supplementary Table\\xa0 1 .\\n In the cancer group, all patients with ovarian cancer had high-grade \\nserous adenocarcinoma (HGSOC) (na=a25) and majority of patients with a \\nbenign ovarian mass (na=a25) had serous cystadenoma (60%). Healthy \\nvolunteers were recruited as the study control group (na=a19). The mean \\nage of patients with ovarian cancer and those with a benign ovarian mass\\n were similar, while healthy controls were relatively younger \\n(Supplementary Table\\xa0 1 ).\\n In the validation cohort, a total of thirteen out of 25 (52.0%) \\npatients had ascites. Similar to the training cohort, the presence of \\nascites did not correlate to higher levels of serum IL6 among the \\npatients with HGSOC (pa=a0.19).   Pre-operative plasma in the \\nvalidation phase cohort was analysed selectively for relevant cytokines \\nincluding CA125 and HE4. PCA analysis of all demographic, blood \\ncomponents and immune factors, similar to the training cohort, revealed \\nIL-6 as the one factor that clustered with RMI score, ROMA, CA125 and \\nHE4 in component 1 which represented 32.4% of total variances in this \\nstudy group (data not shown). These factors were then assessed for their\\n discriminative ability between the three study groups using one-way \\nANOVA, followed by Dunnas multiple comparison test as post hoc \\n(Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 2 ).\\n As observed in the training study, in this validation cohort, IL-6 and \\nRMI, but not ROMA, remained discriminative markers for all three study \\ngroups. Plasma CA125 and HE4, similar to the training phase, displayed \\nsimilar discriminative ability and were not able to distinguish between \\npatients with a benign ovarian mass and healthy controls (Supplementary \\nFig.\\xa0 2 ).   IL-6\\n retained good predictive value in the validation phase by ROC analysis \\nand was clearly able to distinguish malignant ovarian patients from \\ntheir non-malignant counterparts (AUC 0.962, 95% CI 0.926a0.998, \\npa=a4.4aAa10 a11 ). The combination of IL-6 with conventional \\ntests such as RMI score and ROMA or conventional biomarkers such as \\nCA125 or HE4 similarly improved the predictive probability of malignant \\novarian masses in the validation phase (Fig.\\xa0 3 ).\\n Comparison of the ROC curves of IL-6 alone or in combination with \\nconventional tests and biomarkers between the three study groups in the \\nvalidation phase revealed a similar pattern to training phase \\n(Supplementary Table\\xa0 2 ).   The\\n patients in the validation phase were then classified by applying the \\nsplitting rules derived from the classification trees of the training \\nphase dataset to enable predictions of their status. The predicted \\nstatus of the patients was then compared to the actual status of the \\npatients. Inclusion of IL-6 to the trees correctly classified all 19 \\nhealthy control patients as normal, essentially eliminating false \\npositives prior to incorporation of conventional tests and biomarkers. \\nOf the three trees, the classification tree based on IL-6 and CA125 was \\nthe best (Somersa Da=a0.943aA+-a0.028) with 3 out of 25 malignant patients\\n classified as benign and there were no false positives. In comparison, \\nwhen CA125 is used alone, there were 2 cases of false positives. \\nSimilarly, but only marginally better, was the tree based on IL-6 and \\nRMI (Somersa Da=a0.929aA+-a0.030) while the classification tree based on \\nIL-6 and ROMA performed poorly (Somersa Da=a0.607aA+-a0.071) when it was \\ntested on the validation data set. This reduction in goodness of fit, \\nwhich was most evident in the tree that was based on IL-6 and ROMA, is \\nmore likely an example of the general phenomenon of aover fittinga \\nrather than multiplicity. Invariably a statistical model constructed \\nfrom one set of data does not perform as well on a new set of data. \\nHowever, we believe we have demonstrated that the classification tree \\nbased on IL-6 and CA125 performs very well.   We also assessed the \\nusefulness of IL-6 in helping to discriminate ovarian cancer patients. \\nOne of the features of endometrioma is the elevation of CA125 \\nconcentration, which may be misleading or reduce the capacity to \\ndiscriminate endometrioma from ovarian cancer. We obtained sera from ten\\n patients with benign endometrioma and measured CA125 concentration and \\nrelevant cytokines including IL-6. The mean CA125 concentration was \\n109.3aA+-a128.8 IU/L (median 81, range: 7.5a436 IU/L) which was 7-fold \\nhigher than the mean concentration of a serous cystadenoma 20.8aA+-a24.0 \\nIU/L (median 17, range: 7.0a129 IU/L), pa=a0.009. However, the mean IL-6\\n concentration (1.33aA+-a0.90, median 1.2, range: 0.5 to 3.71apg/ml) in \\nthe plasma for these ten patients with endometrioma remained comparable \\nto the mean concentration of IL-6 of patients with benign serous \\ncystadenomas (1.15aA+-a0.52, median 1.4, range 0.5 to 2.79apg/ml), \\npa=a0.16. The concentration of IL-6 in the endometrioma group was still \\nsignificantly lower by 6-fold compared to IL-6 concentration in the \\nmalignant diseases (pa=a1.0aAa10 a6 ). All concentration levels\\n among women with endometrioma were also lower than the threshold point \\nof 3.75apg/ml (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 3 ).   The\\n present study shows for the first time that IL-6, a pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine, overexpressed in sera or plasma of advanced high-grade serous \\novarian cancer patients, is the single most informative cytokine out of \\n28 soluble factors able to enhance the diagnostic efficiency of \\nconventional tools (RMI and ROMA) and biomarkers (CA125 and HE4) to \\ndiscriminate between women with a malignant ovarian mass, benign ovarian\\n pathology and healthy ovaries.   IL-6 had overall good predictive \\nvalue to discriminate malignant ovarian masses in both training and \\nvalidation cohorts, which was comparable to pre-existing current \\ndiagnostic tools- CA125, HE4, RMI score and ROMA. Specifically, in this \\nstudy, IL-6 was an excellent predictive marker for distinguishing \\nbetween advanced malignant and normal ovaries (AUC 1.000, pa=a7.8aAa10 a10 ).   In\\n the present study, the median IL-6 level was 24-fold higher in advanced\\n ovarian cancer patients than those with normal ovaries. The IL-6 level \\nremained at a highly detectable rate in all patients with advanced \\novarian cancer, while the level was undetectable in 23.8% of patients \\nwith normal ovaries in the training phase. While IL-6 can be produced by\\n human ovarian epithelial cells during follicle development, the levels \\nmay not reach the detection threshold  30  .\\n In contrast, excessive levels of circulating IL-6 are observed in \\nadvanced ovarian cancers and this may be contributed by either tumour \\ncells or peritoneal mesothelial cells, both of which are major \\ncontributors to IL-6 production within the tumour microenvironment  31 , 32  .\\n IL-6 in the malignant ascites, serum and plasma of patients with \\nadvanced ovarian cancer have been shown to correlate positively with \\nadvanced disease and poor survival  33 , 34 , 35 , 36  .\\n The current study has demonstrated the diagnostic and predictive value \\nof serum IL-6 alone and in combination with other markers in \\ndiscriminating between malignant and non-malignant ovarian masses.   Past studies have reported higher levels of IL-6 in the serum of patients with ovarian cancer  37 , 38   and have incorporated it in complex multi-marker panels for the detection of ovarian cancer  27 , 39  .\\n To the best of our knowledge, however, this is the only study analyzing\\n the diagnostic value of blood IL-6 singly and in combination with the \\nconventional tests (RMI and ROMA) and biomarkers (CA125 and HE4) in \\nadvanced HGSOC patients.   IL-6 also had superior predictive value \\nthan CA125, HE4, and ROMA in distinguishing between the benign and \\nnormal ovaries group. Although CA125 (at a threshold of &gt;35 U/ml) has\\n not achieved satisfactory sensitivity (81%) and specificity (75%) for \\novarian cancer detection  6 , 40  , CA125 had been reported to have the highest sensitivity for serous subtypes and advanced stages  41  ,\\n which was also evident in this study. In this study population, the \\nsensitivity and specificity of serum CA125 level to discriminate between\\n malignant and non-malignant masses were 96.0% and 79.5% respectively \\nfor the training cohort, while the validation group had a sensitivity of\\n 97.0 and specificity of 81.8%. The higher sensitivity and specificity \\nof serum CA125 level observed maybe attributed to advanced stages of \\novarian cancer and a higher percentage of post-menopausal women compared\\n to those pre-menopausal. The training cohort consisted of twenty-four \\n(36.4%) pre-menopausal and 42 (63.6%) post-menopausal women, while the \\nvalidation group had 24 (34.8%) premenopausal and 45 (65.2%) \\npost-menopausal women.   In the present study, IL-6 but not CA125, \\ncould distinguish between all three study groups in both the training \\nand validation phase cohort. The median IL-6 levels in the training \\nphase were observed to be 4.5-fold higher in benign ovaries compared to \\nnormal ovaries respectively. The use of CA125 in combination with IL-6, \\nlowered false positive rates and achieved higher predictive values \\ncompared to CA125 alone. A similar pattern of improvement was also \\nobserved for RMI, HE4 or ROMA in combination with IL-6.   However, \\nIL-6 alone was not superior to the predictive value of other \\nconventional biomarkers and tests in distinguishing benign and malignant\\n ovarian masses. Serum CA125 or RMI when used alone had higher false \\npositive rates  41  .\\n The combination of IL-6 and CA125 may be particularly useful in \\ndistinguishing ovarian endometrioma with falsely elevated CA125 from \\nmalignant disease. Comparable serum IL-6 levels were previously reported\\n in women with and without endometriosis  42 , 43  , while other investigators have reported elevated levels of IL-6 in endometriosis patients compared with normal ovaries  44 , 45  .\\n Although endometrioma may have elevated levels of IL-6, as observed in \\nour pilot data, the serum IL-6 levels in women with endometrioma were \\nlower than in women with ovarian cancer, in keeping with Darai  et al .  37  .\\n Therefore, the addition of IL-6 to CA125 may be clinically helpful to \\ndistinguish endometrioma compared to use of CA125 alone; this however \\nwarrants evaluation in a larger cohort.   In our study, HE4 alone \\nachieved good overall predictive value for patients with ovarian cancer \\nin both the primary (AUC 0.997) and validation (AUC 0.889) cohorts. \\nHowever, we found that HE4 had lower predictive value in comparison to \\nCA125, when used as a discriminator between benign ovarian mass and \\nnormal ovaries, with AUC of 0.706 for the primary cohort and 0.497 for \\nthe validation cohort. The use of HE4 alone as a biomarker to \\ndistinguish between benign and normal ovaries therefore may not be \\nreliable as shown in previous studies  15 , 46  .\\n The introduction of ROMA which incorporates CA125 and HE4 has been \\npromising as a more specific discriminator of the malignant ovarian mass  22 , 47  .\\n In a prospective evaluation of pre-operative ovarian masses in an \\nAustralian cohort, ROMA was found not to be inferior to RMI in the \\ndetection of ovarian malignancy  47  .\\n Similarly, in our study, ROMA had a good overall predictive value in \\nboth the primary (AUC 0.998) and the validation (AUC 0.996) study groups\\n and was therefore a better predictive tool than HE4 alone or the RMI \\nscore in our study. In addition, the addition of IL-6 to ROMA enhanced \\nthe predictive probability of ROMA to achieve an AUC of 1.000 between \\nall three study populations in this study. The addition of IL-6 to CA125\\n and HE4 achieved an excellent sensitivity and specificity with the \\nhighest accuracy, and therefore may have a potential use in the \\npre-operative assessment for suspicious ovarian masses in less developed\\n countries with poor access to imaging modalities.   There are limited studies available that might be used to define cut-off values for IL-6 as a diagnostic tool  48  .\\n We found a good discriminatory value for IL-6 at a threshold of \\n&gt;3.75apg/ml with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 76.8%, \\npositive predictive value of 69.7%, and negative predictive value of \\n100% in this study. This is an improvement to moderate sensitivity/ \\nspecificity characteristics reported for IL-6 (sensitivity of 61%, \\nspecificity of 79%, positive predictive value of 70%, and negative \\npredictive value of 61%) by Tempfer  et al .  49  \\n The difference may be explained by the selection of the study cohort \\nused and the different threshold level for IL-6 being used compared to \\nthe current study. While we recruited a homogenous group of advanced \\nFIGO stages (III-IV) HGSOC and compared this with benign cystadenoma and\\n patients with normal ovaries, the previous study included all FIGO \\nstages and various subtypes of ovarian cancer and the control group was \\nhealthy blood donors. The threshold level for IL-6 was also lower \\n(0.78apg/ml) when compared to our study (3.75apg/ml). In both the \\ntraining and validation cohorts, we have tried to include a similar age \\ncohort for the control group with age ranging between 40 to 84 years \\nold, however the control group were significantly younger compared to \\nthe cancer patients. As the levels of IL6 have been reported to be \\nincreased in older women, this data may have potential bias in regard to\\n the threshold level of IL6. Future studies with age-matched control may\\n need to be undertaken to validate the threshold level of IL6.   As \\ncytokines are part of the immune system, which respond rapidly to both \\nexternal and internal stimuli, cytokine measurements are highly \\nsensitive and are subject to clinical applicability, reproducibility and\\n quality assurance criteria to minimize result variation  24  .\\n The strength of this study is that we recruited a homogenous ovarian \\ncancer population where all of the women had advanced (Stage III-IV) \\nhigh-grade serous ovarian / fallopian tube cancer and the benign group \\nwere mainly patients with a serous cystadenoma, with patients in the \\ncontrol group having their ovaries removed as part of risk reduction \\nsurgery. The training phase had a pre-selected population with exclusion\\n of clinical conditions that might have interfered with levels of \\ncirculating cytokines. The concentration of IL-6 is largely affected by \\nexercise, weight, stress, significant medical conditions and \\nimmunosuppressive drugs  24  .\\n Sample collection and storage may also influence cytokine measurement, \\nand this can affect the validity of the test. Sera samples were \\ncollected prior to surgical intervention. The use of lithium heparin and\\n sodium citrate were avoided as it can decrease the measured levels for \\npro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF  50  .\\n In contrast, the patients recruited to the validation phase were not \\nscreened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the \\ntraining phase study. Therefore, these patients had complex medical \\nco-morbidities such as major cardiovascular diseases, complicated or \\nuncontrolled medical conditions, active autoimmune disease as well as \\ntaking immune suppressing medications. This cohort which may more \\nclosely reflect the true population encountered during clinical \\nscreening, not only allowed validation of IL-6 as a potential biomarker,\\n but also likely demonstrated the true potential of IL-6 as a diagnostic\\n biomarker.   The study is consistent with findings from Nowak  et al .,\\n that patients with advanced ovarian cancer had higher level of \\npro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 in the serum. Thus, the result of our \\nstudy supports the critical role of inflammation in ovarian cancer \\ndevelopment and progression. As IL-6 plays a substantial role in \\npromoting cancer cell proliferation  24  ,\\n elevated concentration of IL-6 are observed not only in association \\nwith primary epithelial ovarian cancers, but also in a variety of other \\nsolid tumors including breast, lung and colorectal cancers, which can \\nmake diagnosis particularly challenging  24 , 51 , 52  .\\n The possibility of metastatic breast, lung or bowel cancers merits \\nconsideration in the differential diagnosis for a woman with a \\nsuspicious ovarian mass and increased IL-6 concentration.   The \\npotential use of peripheral blood IL-6 concentration as a screening tool\\n is promising with IL-6 levels found significantly elevated in early \\nstages (FIGO Stage I and II) of ovarian cancers compared to benign \\novarian masses or healthy controls  39 , 53  .\\n The use of IL6 may improve preoperative discrimination of suspected \\novarian tumours, however the findings in this study alone are \\ninsufficient to support it for generalized ovarian screening. Given the \\nsmall number of true early-stage, high-grade serous ovarian cancers \\navailable, it was necessary to make inferences using advanced disease \\ncases. Inclusion of early stages of epithelial ovarian cancer and \\ncomparison with benign masses and normal ovaries in a larger \\nstage-stratified cohort will be required to ascertain the role of IL6 in\\n generalized ovarian cancer screening including multiple and earlier \\ndisease stages.   As with any exploratory, observational study, \\nthere is a risk of aover-fittinga a predictive model to the observed \\ndata, however inclusion in the study of a second data set to check the \\nusefulness of the model goes some way to alleviating this risk, and we \\nfound that IL-6 was still able to accurately identify and triage all 19 \\nnormal patients as normal in the validation study. The addition of IL-6 \\nto CA125 or to RMI was further validated as improving their diagnostic \\nutility. Albeit, the analyses generated in the training cohort can be \\nfurther optimized to specifically account for co-morbidities, given \\nexclusion of these confounders resulted in an increased of ROC-AUC value\\n from 0.962 to 0.985 and 0.993 respectively (Figs.\\xa0 3  and  4 )\\n for the capacity of IL-6 in the validation phase to distinguish between\\n malignant and non-malignant ovarian mass. These findings therefore \\nshould be considered when using IL-6 in clinical screening as these will\\n be potential confounders that may influence the levels of IL-6.   IL-6\\n alone may be a clinically reliable biomarker to distinguish between \\npatients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and those \\nwith normal ovaries. In combination with RMI score, ROMA, HE4 or CA125, \\nIL-6 may enhance the predictive power of existing conventional tools or \\nbiomarkers in distinguishing between patients with malignant and benign \\novarian masses as well as those with a benign ovarian mass and normal \\novaries. Patients with cysts incidentally identified on imaging could \\npotentially be spared surgical intervention. These results indicate that\\n IL-6 may be a useful diagnostic tool for the pre-operative assessment \\nof suspicious ovarian masses. These results support further studies, \\nincluding those including earlier stages of the disease, to explore and \\nexpand on, the potential utility of adding IL-6 to routine diagnostic \\ntests.

None of the 266 people in quarantine in Darwin after being evacuated from the coronavirus epicentre in  China  have shown any signs of the respiratory infection, medical authorities say.\\xa0   Japanese\\n military personnel set up a covered walkway next to the Diamond \\nPrincess cruise ship today where thousands of people are in \\nquarantine\\xa0   Four Australians are among more than\\n 65 newly-confirmed coronavirus cases aboard a quarantined cruise ship \\ndocked at Yokohama, Japanese authorities have confirmed\\xa0   Five\\n of the 15 confirmed Australian cases of coronavirus have been cleared, \\nthe government says, as it reassured those living near the Darwin \\nevacuation centre that they are not at risk.   Local health \\nofficials confirmed that among the new infections were 45 Japanese \\nnationals, 11 Americans, four Australians, three from the Philippines \\nand one each from Canada and Ukraine.\\xa0   The announcement last \\nweek that the Australians would be quarantined at a disused mining \\nvillage near Darwin sparked anger among local parents, with the evacuees\\n housed less than one kilometre from the Good Shepherd Lutheran College \\nin Howard Springs.   While one mother said she would keep her \\nteenage son home for at least the 14 days of the quarantine, Australia's\\n deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said if he had children at the \\nschool, 'I would have no hesitation in my kids going to school today.'   The\\n new cases aboard the Diamond Princess are in addition to 70 cases \\npreviously announced aboard the luxury ship, bringing the total number \\nof cases from the vessel to 135. Officials in protective suits walk on \\nboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess in Yokohama today   The\\n Northern Territory's Acting Chief Health Officer Dianne Stephens spoke \\nat the school on Monday to reassure parents and said there was a lot of \\nmisinformation.   That included reports in China that the virus \\ncould be spread by airborne transmission, which has sparked fears \\nschoolchildren could end up catching it from mosquitoes.   'We have \\ninvestigated that at a national level, we have reached in to Chinese \\nauthorities and it is a misuse of the word airborne,' she told \\nreporters.   'There has been no evidence of infection amongst any of\\n those cohorts here or in Christmas Island, who are nearly halfway \\nthrough their quarantine period   'It is definitely a droplet borne \\ndisease. If I am within one metre and I sneeze and cough on you and I \\nhave the novel coronavirus, then you are at risk of getting infected.'   Face masks help prevent droplet infection, she said.   Prof\\n Stephens said it was unfortunate the community and school were not \\nconsulted about the quarantining but said the decision would not have \\nbeen Face masks if it threatened anyone's safety.   A girl suspected\\n of having coronavirus on far more remote Christmas Island, where a \\nprevious planeload of Australians was sent last week, has also tested \\nnegative.   A passenger stands on the balcony on board the Diamond Princess yesterday with guests facing further tests for coronavirus\\xa0   The\\n evacuees, including 92 children, at the Manigurr-ma Village at Howard \\nSprings, were tired but in good spirits, said Abigail Trewin, a director\\n with the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre.   They \\nwere receiving daily health checks and had been separated into smaller \\ngroups to prevent the virus spreading if anyone did have it, she said.   'The\\n kids are super excited to be home on Aussie soil; there have been \\nrepeated thankyous for bringing people home, which is lovely to hear,' \\nshe said.   The number of cases worldwide has reached more than \\n40,500 while more than 900 people have died from the virus, mainly in \\nWuhan where the outbreak began.   The virus is believed to have emerged in a market selling wild animals in Wuhan last year before spreading across China.

The Inpex workers camp (pictured), 500 metres away from the school, is housing around 280 Australians for two weeks\\xa0   Other parents are not worried their children will be infected.   Nicolette\\n McCourt said social media allowed a lot of false and misleading \\ninformation to circulate and her children would remain at school.

Saturday will mark two weeks since Prime Minister  Scott Morrison \\n announced a temporary 14 day ban on\\xa0foreign travellers who have \\nleft or passed through mainland China from arriving on our shores.\\xa0   Health Minister Greg Hunt has warned the travel ban will likely be extended as the worldwide death toll surges towards 1000.   'We expect it will continue. We're not putting a timeframe on it,' the minister told  The Australian .   The\\n tourism industry is paying a heavy price from Australia's temporary ban\\n on Chinese travellers, which will likely be extended later this week   Mr Hunt added the government acted on the best medical advice to implement the ban.   'Ultimately,\\n our job a| our responsibilAity, is to provide protection and national \\nhealth security for the Australian people,' he said.\\xa0   'They've been difficult decisAions but made on the basis of the medical advice and we'll implemenAt the medical advice.'

Some Australian universities have already delayed the start of the semester due to the coronavirus.\\xa0   Federal education Minister Dan Tehan acknowledged extended bans could cause a major disruption.   'It's very much wait and see what happens,' Mr Tehan told Sky News on Sunday.   But\\n my hope is that we will see some sort of a breakthrough and we will be \\nable to get students here for the first semester, but we will have to \\nwait and see.'\\xa0\\xa0   Foreign travellers who have \\nrecently left or passed through mainland China are currently banned from\\n entering our shores.

Adding weight to the calls for urgent climate action are the findings\\n of a new study, Impacts of Carbon Dioxide Emissions on Global Intense \\nHydrometeorological Disasters, published in the Climate, Disaster and \\nDevelopment Journal.   Focused on extreme flood and storm events over 46 years, the research\\n directly connects the build-up of carbon emissions to the increase in \\nthe devastating floods and storms we are seeing today.   The study warns that the number of climate disasters could double in \\n13 years, and \"severely damage the environment, socioeconomic progress, \\nand welfare of millions of people worldwide\". Its findings make a strong\\n and urgent case for implementing climate change mitigation and \\nadaptation measures.   Although the Jan 23 study focuses on just two impacts of \\nclimate-flooding and storms such as hurricanes and typhoonsi 1/4 it is one \\nmore \"piece of evidence\" showing just how serious climate change has \\nbecome, the lead author of the study, Ramon Lopez, said.   \"There is little time left to avoid even worse catastrophes for the \\nensuing decades than the ones that we are now predicting for the next \\ndecade,\" said Lopez, a professor at the University of Chile, in \\nSantiago, who has spent much of his academic life examining the economic\\n impact of climate change.   He said the time has now come to end the global political debate and \\npromises of policy changes. \"What we need now is real action, especially\\n by the big polluters,\" Lopez said.   \"Short of massive social pressure, governments are not going to do \\nmuch more than make promisesi 1/4 and while social awareness is rising, \\neffective pressures on politicians that we now observe are just not \\nenough.   \"Some leaders simply do not see the need for action, and others are \\njust too much concerned about the short run and lack the courage\" to \\nimplement the needed climate action measures, he said.   Don Clifton, with the School of Management at the University of South\\n Australia, agrees. \"I don\\'t expect those in the current (Australian) \\ngovernment who deny the human link with global warming will change their\\n minds,\" he said.   \"For them it is not a matter of science; it\\'s an ideological issue. No amount of scientific evidence will change this.\"    High costs    Lopez said the cost in terms of human lives, and quality of life, for\\n the people who are and will be affected by flooding and storms will be \\nhigh.   \"The economic cost alone of relocating entire cities or building the \\nnecessary infrastructure to protect against flooding is huge,\" he said.   As an example, he cited Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New \\nOrleans, in the United States, in 2005. \"The cost of partially \\nprotecting the city against another Katrina has been $25 billion so \\nfar,\" he said.   Vinod Thomas, a former senior vice-president with the World Bank, who\\n co-authored the study, said if carbon emissions continue to rise at the\\n current rate \"we can expect to see more intense storms and floods\".   Thomas, who also worked for the Asian Development Bank and is now a \\nvisiting professor with the Asian Institute of Management in Manila in \\nthe Philippines, said: \"It is quite obvious from the collapse of the UN \\nClimate Change Conference (COP 25)\" in Madrid in December that \\npolicymakers \"show no urgency to reverse climate change\".   The study used climate data from 155 countriesi 1/4 taken from 1970 to \\n2016i 1/4 and a statistical and econometric approach, rather than climate \\nmodels, to assess the factors that have contributed to the increase in \\nthe frequency of intense flood and storm events.   \"The findings show that in addition to socioeconomic factors, the \\ncontinuous increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the past \\nfour decades is significantly correlated with the increase in the number\\n of extreme flood and storm events,\" said Thomas.   \"That means human actions have a decisive role in climate change. The\\n results show that global climate conditions significantly affect the \\nfrequency of these disasters.\"   The results of the study suggest that if the CO2 level increases by 1\\n percent, floods and storms would increase by nearly 9 percent.   David Holmes, director of the Monash Climate Change Communication \\nResearch Hub at Melbourne\\'s Monash University, said the recent bushfires\\n in Australia are \"not just about cyclical drought, ...but about the \\nfact that southern and inland areas of Australia are becoming much drier\\n in a way that is overwhelming typical variability\".   \"In the last 15 years, Australia saw eight of its 10 warmest years on\\n record. Climate scientists tell us that, with climate change, weather \\nsystems increasingly move poleward,\" he said.   \"This means that storm tracks that once brought moisture from the \\nSouthern Ocean right up the east coast are not reaching as far, and \\ninland and forested areas are becoming much drier.\"  ', \"    Published:    16:46 AEDT, 11 February 2020     |    Updated:    18:12 AEDT, 11 February 2020        An\\n Australian who returned an initial positive result for the coronavirus \\nhas been cleared - as the global death toll scales over 1000.

Predictably, many condemned the suggestion that the menas competition\\n should be renamed. Some argued that we shouldnat mess with over 150 \\nyears of tradition, seemingly forgetting that before the AFL was the \\nAFL, it was the VFL, and before that, the VFA. Others argued a without \\nfurther elucidation a that this was yet another case of apolitical \\ncorrectness gone mada. A tired slogan all too often advanced without any\\n attempt to explain it, the argument is supposed to be self-evident. Are\\n we being told that any attempt to question the words we use and the \\nmeanings they make is an illness of mind, a kind of asicknessa, a \\npathology?    Other critics noted that the menas competition is the anorma, meaning\\n that there is no need to distinguish it from the womenas. To do so \\nwould be an insult to the menas game, since we already know that aAFLa \\nis synonymous with men. Proponents of the aMa are of course well aware \\nof its normative status. This is precisely the problem they want us to \\nreflect on.   Let me explain why so many footy fans have chosen this as their issue and why we are having this debate.   First and foremost a as the debate itself reminds us a language matters. Language does not simply  reflect  society but  shapes  it. These issues have been the subject of academic analysis by experts in semiotics and linguistics for decades.   Language reflects and reinforces meanings, shapes systems of thought \\nand social norms, including the things we come to value and devalue. Our\\n values and norms are shaped by the repetition of these words and the \\nrelations between them.    There are other ways that language has shaped and constrained how we \\ncome to think of women and it has long been dominated by words that \\nposition men as the default or norm. Words such as amankinda and \\namanmadea are used to denote humanity as a whole. They reinforce the \\nnotion that this is a world by, for and of men. Many of us who sit \\noutside these norms feel our absence acutely, and frequently, in ways \\nthat those who occupy the dominant status may never notice, be aware of,\\n or appreciate. To us, it matters.   Laws and other canonical documents often referenced only men, raising\\n questions about whether women (and others, such as non-white men) \\nexisted in the eyes of the law at all. In some cases, the absence of \\nreferences to women meant that they had no rights in law, and could not \\nbenefit from them. For those others, language  really  mattered, in a very real and tangible way.   These tendencies in language a to privilege men and erase or omit \\nwomen a are pervasive, widespread, and continue to linger today. And one\\n need not be excluded from legal rights to care about these omissions \\nand erasures or to feel that our lives might be made just a bit better \\nif our language was more deliberately inclusive.   The debate over AFLM cannot be separated from these histories and the\\n injustices that language helps to perpetuate. It matters that the \\nsportas governing body (the aAFLa) is wholly synonymous with the menas \\ncompetition (the aAFLa) so that the menas competition remains the \\ndefault, or norm.   What message does this send to women, men, boys and girls about the \\nvalue placed on both women and womenas sport? It signals that we are \\nlesser. This is repeated in every other aspect of the sportas \\ngovernance: from inequalities in pay and resourcing, the shortened \\nseason, the difficult conditions under which many athletes compete, and \\nthe long fight to even get a womenas competition in the first place.   The subordinate status of  AFLW \\n is produced not just by historic inequities, differences in resourcing \\nand pay inequities but by the continued positioning of womenas sport as \\nan afterthought: a symbolic and literal aothera to the menas. If this \\nweekas debate is anything to go by, many people think this is ajust a \\nfacta and prefer it to stay this way. But that is a backward-looking \\nview; one which clings to old linguistic and structural patterns. It is a\\n view that must change if the game is to grow, and if gender equality a \\nin sport and society a is to ever become a reality.   When leading sports commentators dismiss the aMa debate as silly and \\nmeaningless, then, they demonstrate an ignorance of languageas \\nconstitutive power, the historic privileging of men as the norm and the \\nforce and significance of linguistic repetition.   It would be a small gesture to add an aMa. It wonat fix everything, \\nbut Iam not sure that anyone is claiming it will. For many of us, it \\nwould be a profound and meaningful step. One that will harm no-one, but \\nmean a great deal to those of us so often on the outside. This includes \\nfuture generations of girls, who do not yet know they are the aothera. \\nLet us hope they never need to.

Many states lack laws \\nwhich directly criminalise and punish exerting ownership or control over\\n another person, according to the Antislavery in Domestic Legislation \\ndatabase, launched at the United Nations headquarters in New York.   'Slavery\\n is far from being illegal everywhere and we hope our research will move\\n the conversation beyond this popular myth,' said Katarina Schwarz, a \\nresearcher at the University of Nottingham's Rights Lab, which led work \\non the slavery database.   Slavery is not a crime in almost half the countries in the world, a study of global laws said on Wednesday (file picture)   'It\\n will surprise many people to learn that in all of these countries there\\n are no criminal laws in place to prosecute, convict and punish people \\nfor subjecting people to the most extreme forms of exploitation.'   More\\n than 40 million people are held in modern slavery, which includes \\nforced labor and forced marriage, according to estimates by the \\nInternational Labour Organization and the anti-slavery group the Walk \\nFree Foundation.   Ending modern slavery by 2030 was among the global goals adopted unanimously by members of the United Nations in 2015.   But\\n although historic laws that once allowed slavery have been scrapped \\nworldwide, researchers for the database found that many of the 193 U.N. \\nmember states have not gone on to explicitly criminalise slavery and \\nother exploitation.   There is no criminal law against slavery in 94\\n countries - almost half of U.N. states - said researchers at Rights \\nLab, which reviewed the study's findings with the Castan Centre for \\nHuman Rights at Monash University in Australia.   It found almost \\ntwo thirds of countries apparently failed to criminalise any of the main\\n four practices associated with slavery - serfdom, debt bondage, forced \\nmarriage, and child trafficking - except in the context of human \\ntrafficking.   Researchers noted that almost all countries had some form of domestic anti-trafficking legislation in place.   But\\n loopholes mean exploitation may have to be prosecuted indirectly under \\nrelated laws, and in some cases abusers may escape punishment for \\nexploitation altogether, said Schwarz.   The report reflects the \\nfact that understanding of slavery has expanded to include a wide range \\nof exploitation and laws have not always caught up, said Jakub Sobik, a \\nspokesman for the charity Anti-Slavery International.   But he said simply toughening legislation was not the answer.   'Slavery\\n in its nature looks to exploit people who fall slightly outside the \\nrule of law,' he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 'There is a need \\nfor wide-ranging policies that address the wider context and systemic \\nreasons why people are made vulnerable to being tricked and trapped and \\ncontrolled by another person.'

Currently  more than 100,000 Chinese students ,\\n who already have Australian student visas and were planning on \\ncommencing their studies this month, are stranded outside of Australia \\nas a result of the  governmentas 14-day travel ban from mainland China .   On\\n Wednesday, Australiaas Global Reputation Taskforce a an emergency \\ncouncil of universities and education providers a met with education \\nminister Dan Tehan and trade minister Simon Birmingham to discuss how \\nthey could limit  the potential $8bn hit to the economy .   Phil\\n Honeywood, the chair of the taskforce, told Guardian Australia the \\nministers had secured new pathways for online courses a which would let \\nisolated students keep their Australian enrolments.   But he warned \\nthat a visa approval freeze means Australia could aabsolutely lose outa \\nto competitors as Chinese students could easily ago down the roada and \\nobtain student visas for the US, the UK or Canada instead.   The \\ngovernment has not yet announced if the travel ban will be extended by \\nanother fortnight, but education providers are anot optimistica and \\npreparing for the worst.   Honeywood, who is also the head of the \\nInternational Education Association of Australia, said internet \\nrestrictions would be lifted for students, so they could reach \\nuniversity portals for lecture recordings and slides, among other sites.   aThere\\n have been challenges over many years with online learning into China \\nbut the Chinese government has acknowledged that a more effectual \\narrangement is appropriate because of the isolation,a he said.   aWeave\\n been able to make good progress on online learning options into China. \\nThere have been really worthwhile negotiations with the Chinese embassy.\\n A number of platforms have been agreed to to deliver online courses to \\nstudents who are offshore still.   aNot all courses will be suited \\nto online delivery. There will be issues with which units of study can \\nbe provided, for what period of time. [But] it is definitely a better \\nsituation than we were facing a couple of weeks ago.a   But the \\nuniversities are concerned that new visa delays, combined with the \\ntravel ban, mean Australia could lose out to other countries.   New \\nstudent visa approvals have been frozen by the department of home \\naffairs since 1 February, even for students who have already been \\naccepted by Australian universities.   Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge  confirmed to the Australian \\n that the department was anot finalising applications for individuals \\ncurrently in mainland Chinaa due to aenhanced border measuresa.   International students  contributed $34bn to the Australian economy \\n last year. Australiaas main competitors for Chinese students, Canada, \\nthe US and the UK run on a different academic year, starting in \\nSeptember, meaning they are less disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak \\nthis year.   aThe issue we have got is visas allegedly bring processed but not approved,a Honeywood said.   aA\\n bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. If youare a student, and you\\n canat get an Australian student visa to travel, any time you can go \\ndown the road to the Canadian embassy or the US embassy and they are \\nstill happily approving visas.   aChinese students, even if they \\ncanat travel to Australia now, once they have been given a student visa \\nto come and study in Australia, they can once the virus is contained.   aBut\\n because no visas have been approved, they are thinking aHow long is \\nthis going on for? Even when the virus is contained, I canat come to \\nAustralia to study because of the whole visa process. Iall go to Canada \\nand the UK and delay my start date.aa   Honeywood said education \\nminister Tehan was working with immigration minister Tudge ato get some \\nclarification about what might be possible in that visa approval spacea.   Meanwhile, individual universities are also offering alternate course schedules for affected students. Melbourneas  Monash University has already pushed back the start date \\n of its semester by a week, while the ANU in Canberra has announced a \\nsemester during the traditional winter break to allow Chinese students \\nto catch up on courses.   Other universities, such as the University\\n of New South Wales, have recently changed to a trimester system, and \\nare encouraging students to defer their enrolment to the next trimester,\\n which starts around the beginning of June.   Honeywood said the \\nuniversities ahave to abide by the chief medical officeras \\ndeterminationa on the length of the travel ban, but that Australiaas \\nhigher education sector was uniquely vulnerable to the delay.   aMore\\n than other study destination country, we are caught by geographic \\nlocation and the fact that our academic year starts at the start of the \\ncalendar year,a he said.   aWhereas our main competitors, like \\nCanada, the US and UK, their academic year doesnat start until later, in\\n September. They arenat faced with a large influx of Chinese students \\nwanting to commence studies until later this year.

National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster says nobody knows how long the virus will last.   'If you say it is going to finish in a month or so then you hopefully get a short, pretty significant impact,' he said.   If that proves the case, there will probably be a small hit to growth in the March quarter of this year.

The health ministeras statement, it turned out, had been \\nambiguous. The captain of the vessel, the Diamond Princess, announced \\nnarrower criteria for offshore quarantine: passengers 80 or older with \\nunderlying medical conditions or windowless cabins.   aLooks like weare not going anywhere,a said Ms. Montgomery, 67.   The misunderstanding punctuated what critics call  Japanas bungled communications \\n during the crisis, reinforcing how the nation has been vexed by an \\nepidemiological challenge that grows each day. With more and more of the\\n Diamond Princess 3,400 anxious  passengers and crew getting sick a possibly infecting one another  a health officials have even raised the possibility of prolonging the quarantine, now set to expire next Wednesday.   Precisely\\n how the coronavirus has been spreading aboard the ship is just one of \\nmany unknowns in the afflictionas reach into Japan. The country also \\nannounced its first death from the coronavirus, of a woman in her 80s in\\n Kanagawa Prefecture, which includes Yokohama.   The authorities \\nsaid the woman did not appear to have traveled to China, the center of \\nthe epidemic, before falling ill. Her death was the third so far outside\\n mainland China; the others were in the Philippines and Hong Kong.   Japanas\\n health ministry also announced 44 new coronavirus cases from the ship, \\nraising the total to 218. Counting those from the vessel, total cases in\\n Japan have surpassed 250, the most of any country other than China.   The\\n clumsy messaging aside, the move by the health ministry to begin \\nletting some people off the Diamond Princess was clearly a response to  mounting stress on board \\n as the quarantine slogs toward its planned conclusion in less than a \\nweek. The step also reflected the particular risk that the virus appears\\n to pose to the elderly.   aPeople in the shipas \\nsurroundings are kind of in a cesspool of probability of being \\ninfected,a said Dr. Peter Katona, an infectious disease specialist at \\nthe University of California, Los Angeles.   aWe donat really \\nunderstand the transmission of this virus very well,a he added. aSo I \\nthink that keeping people in their rooms and letting them out briefly is\\n about as good as you are going to be able to do on a ship, but the \\npsychological impact of that is hard to measure.a   The health \\nminister, Katsunobu Kato, said the government would consider expanding \\nthe criteria to include passengers under 80 years old in the coming \\ndays.   According to a document distributed to\\n several embassies by Japanas foreign ministry and seen by The New York \\nTimes, the Japanese government is discussing plans to administer \\ncoronavirus tests to people aboard the ship in tranches to determine if \\nmore can be quarantined onshore. Some passengers have been calling for \\ntesting of everyone on board, a step the government has called \\nimpractical.   Their psychological stress worsened on Thursday as \\nthe health ministry announced the new cases. The authorities have said \\nthat a small number of the 218 infected are in serious condition.   aI\\n have worked hard to stay calm, but now itas getting so much harder,a \\nSarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, Calif., said \\nin a text message. aIt appears that we are put at risk daily by staying \\non the ship.a   Some epidemiologists said it \\nwas possible that the bulk of the people receiving diagnoses now had \\ncontracted the virus before the quarantine began on Feb. 4. The outbreak\\n has been traced to a man who disembarked from the ship on Jan. 25 in \\nHong Kong and later tested positive.   For more than a week after \\nhis departure, passengers shared buffets, sat close to each other in \\ntheater performances and played mahjong on deck.   aThe curve youare\\n seeing is a natural epidemiological wave,a said Dr. Allen Cheng, an \\ninfectious disease specialist at Monash University in Melbourne, \\nAustralia. aThe first person may have infected a number of people, and \\nthose secondary cases have caused tertiary cases, and what weare seeing \\nnow is the natural incubation of those tertiary cases.a   With crew \\nmembers living and eating in close quarters, the chances for new \\ninfections rises the longer everyone stays on the ship. The danger was \\nunderlined on Wednesday when the health ministry announced that one of \\nits own officials had been infected after helping to evaluate passengers\\n and crew members for symptoms. The official had been wearing a mask and\\n gloves but not a hazardous materials suit.   aThere is a \\npossibility that infections have spread despite the fact that passengers\\n have been isolated on board,a said Mitsuyoshi Urashima, a professor of \\nmolecular epidemiology at Jikei University Hospital in Tokyo. aItas \\nbetter to let them off, as we donat know the cause of infection at this \\nstage.a   Passengers were growing concerned that \\nthe longer they stayed on board, the longer the quarantine could be \\nextended for passengers who are potentially exposed to confirmed \\ninfections.   aThe logic and the basis for the \\nquarantine is that if people do not have a fever or show signs of \\nsickness after 14 days, that they donat have the virus,a Mr. Montgomery,\\n the passenger, said. aBut the problem is, on this petri dish of a ship,\\n is that three days prior to the 19th, we may have an interaction with \\nsomebody in the hallway or on the decka who is infected.   On \\nWednesday, he said, when the couple went out for a prescribed fresh air \\nbreak, another passenger was coughing in the hallway as they returned to\\n their cabin.   aSo this whole thing is based on a false logic,a he said.   In\\n a briefing earlier this week, Masami Sakoi, a health ministry official,\\n said it was possible that people exposed to infected passengers would \\nhave to effectively reset the clocks on their quarantine periods.   Ms.\\n Montgomery suggested that the governments of the countries with \\npassengers or crew members on the Diamond Princess should offer to house\\n people in quarantine facilities on land.   aIf the U.S. embassy \\ntook the Americans off and took us away from here and quarantined and \\ntested us and they did that with every nationality, I think that would \\nbe more effective,a she said.   Even so, finding space where such a \\nlarge number of people could be safely isolated and given proper medical\\n care could be a challenge, especially as Japan is now seeing fresh \\ncases elsewhere. On Thursday, the health ministry announced three new \\ncases, involving a taxi driver and a doctor, in addition to the death \\nfrom the coronavirus.   aWith those waves of new \\ninfections every day, that would challenge the most resilient personas \\nsense of security,a said Benjamin Cowie, an infectious disease physician\\n at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne.\\n aBut thatas a very substantial number of people to then try to have to \\nquarantine anywhere on the shore.a   Even with the \\nrising stress, some passengers were making the best of their time \\ntrapped on board. Aun Na Tan, 43, an administrator from Australia who is\\n sharing a windowless cabin with her husband, 44, and two teenage \\nchildren, said they were playing card games and watching movies together\\n while her husband works remotely and her children keep up with homework\\n online.   In such close quarters, Ms. Tan said, amy daughter hops \\ninto my bed for a cuddle every now and then. Iam just enjoying the \\nopportunity. They get less and less as she gets older.a   Even some who might be eligible to quarantine off shore said they would stick it out on the ship.   aLuckily,\\n weare staying in a stateroom thatas slightly larger, so weare fine with\\n it,a said Masako Ishida, 61, who is traveling with her mother and \\nstepfather, who are in their 80s. aWe wouldnat mind at all if weare the \\nlast ones to disembark, as long as those in need can leave the ship. It \\nwould be easier if we stayed here until the 19th and relax.a   Reporting was contributed by Eimi Yamamitsu, Hisako Ueno, Makiko Inoue and Ben Dooley.   Updated March 24, 2020   It seems to spread  very easily from person to person, \\n especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen \\ncan be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are \\ncoughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a \\ncontaminated surface and then touch our face.   No.  The first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine began in mid-March. \\n Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, but \\neven if it is proved safe and effective, it probably will not be \\navailable for 12 to18 months.   Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and  little is known about this particular virus so far. \\n It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still \\nuncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions a\\n not just those with respiratory diseases a particularly hard.    If youave been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, \\n and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call\\n a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, \\nhow to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially\\n infecting or exposing others.   If youare sick and you think youave been exposed to the new coronavirus,  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears.  They\\n will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that thereas a \\nchance a because of a lack of testing kits or because youare \\nasymptomatic, for instance a you wonat be able to get tested.   If the family member doesnat need hospitalization and\\n can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs \\nand monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as \\npossible,  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. \\n If thereas space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room\\n and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick \\nperson and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the \\nroom. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to \\nregularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. \\nDonat forget to wash your hands frequently.   Experts  are divided on how much protection a regular surgical mask, or even a scarf, can provide \\n for people who arenat yet sick. The W.H.O. and C.D.C. say that unless \\nyouare already sick, or caring for someone who is, wearing a face mask \\nisnat necessary.  And stockpiling high-grade N95 masks will make it \\nharder for nurses and other workers to access the resources they need. \\nBut researchers are also finding that there are more cases of \\nasymptomatic transmission than were known early on in the pandemic. And a\\n few experts say that masks could offer some protection in crowded \\nplaces where it is not possible to stay 6 feet away from other people. \\nMasks donat replace hand-washing and social distancing.   Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves,  the supply chain remains strong.  And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.   Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who donat live in your home.  Even\\n if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, \\ngetting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.     Thatas not a good idea. \\n Even if youare retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds\\n so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense.\\n But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a\\n yearas worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next \\nfive years.   Watching your balance go up and down can be scary.  You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions a donat! \\n If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure \\nyouare at least saving as much as you can to get that afree money.a  ', \"    Published:    02:06 AEDT, 14 February 2020     |    Updated:    07:14 AEDT, 14 February 2020        An\\n Australian racehorse trainer in Wuhan has the described the city as \\n'out of this world' as it continues to grapple with the deadly  coronavirus  outbreak.\\xa0   Rui\\n Severino, who is working at the Yulong Jockey Club in Wuhan, said \\nrapidly increasing cases of the deadly virus was taking a toll on the \\nlocal community.\\xa0   There have now been more than 1,300 \\ncasualties, including 242 people who died in Hubei province, of which \\nWuhan is the capital, on the same day.

Kevin Rudd\\n has slammed Peter Dutton's decision to send Wuhan evacuees to Christmas\\n Island, suggesting the home affairs minister would have treated them \\ndifferently if they were 'white'   'I supposed the question \\nI'd like to hear Mr Dutton answer, is simply this: If the dual-nationals\\n we were rescuing from this virus happened to be Brits or happened to be\\n Americans, would he be so quick to lodge them on Christmas Island and \\nto mining camps outside of Darwin? I don't think so,' he said.\\xa0   'The\\n bottom line is you could secure quarantine facilities in a range of \\nother places closer to civilisation in Australia, so I'm always \\nconcerned when Mr Dutton puts his hands to these questions.'\\xa0   Mr\\n Rudd said if he were still prime minister he would happily comply with \\nthe advice of health authorities, but questioned whether the government \\nhad been presented with other options.   'I would love to see \\npublicly released the menu of options handed to Mr Dutton from the \\nmedical authorities outlining where these folks could've been \\nquarantined.   'I would like to see the menu of options and why Mr \\nDutton chose these two particular options, and what he would have done \\nhad we been dealing with white people with a virus as well.\\xa0   'I'll leave that and I look forward to his answer at some stage.'

From Friday, foreign nationals who \\nhave been in mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia for \\n14 days from the time they left.   'We did not take this decision lightly,' Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday.   'We\\n are very mindful of the disruption and economic impacts of these \\narrangements, but I note Australia is one of 58 countries that has \\nintroduced some form of travel restrictions.'   But the Chinese \\nembassy said the ban should be lifted, saying the World Health \\nOrganisation didn't recommend travel or trade restrictions on China.   'We express our deep regret and dissatisfaction over the Australian government's announcement,' a spokesman said in a statement.   'Only Australia and a small number of countries have taken such extreme measures which are an overreaction indeed.'   Australian\\n citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter, as will \\ntheir immediate family members, but they must self-isolate for 14 days \\nfrom the time they left mainland China.   The restrictions will be reviewed in one week.   Mr\\n Rudd weighed in on the issue as hundreds of Australians remain \\nquarantined on the island - historically used as an immigration \\ndetention centre   Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan \\nMurphy said the key concern was the spread of the virus, officially \\nknown as COVID-19, across China.   There are now more than 60,000 \\nconfirmed cases of the virus, most of them in the province of Hubei \\nwhere it was first detected, and 1357 people have died.   More than \\n240 deaths were reported on Wednesday alone, the highest number of \\nfatalities on a single day since the virus was first reported in \\nDecember.   Of the 15 cases in Australia, six have been cleared and the remaining nine are all stable.   No\\n quarantined Australians at Christmas Island and Darwin have tested \\npositive for the virus, with the first group of evacuees due to return \\nhome on Monday.   Universities are contacting their Chinese students\\n to ensure they understand how the extension of travel restrictions \\naffect them and to provide support.

A day before 328 Americans were to be \\nwhisked away from a contaminated cruise ship in Japan, the U.S. Embassy \\nin Tokyo told passengers that no one infected with the  coronavirus  would be allowed to board charter flights to the United States.   But as  the evacuees \\n began filing onto two reconfigured cargo planes early Monday for \\ndepartures to military bases in California or Texas, some noticed tented\\n areas separated from the rest of the cabin.   Then reality hit: \\nAfter 12 days stuck on the cruise ship where more and more people were \\ntesting positive for the virus, they were now sharing planes with people\\n carrying the same pathogen they were desperate to escape.   aI \\ndidnat know until we were in the air,a said Carol Montgomery, 67, a \\nretired administrative assistant from San Clemente, Calif. aI saw an \\narea of plastic sheeting and tape.a   While \\nthe planes were aloft, the State Department and the Department of Health\\n and Human Services said in a joint statement that the results for 14 \\npassengers who had been tested two or three days earlier had come back \\npositive a just as they were heading to the airport in buses.   American\\n officials, it turned out, had started bringing the passengers home \\nwithout actually knowing their test results. But because the evacuation \\nhad already begun by the time Japanese officials relayed those results, \\nofficials decided to let the infected evacuees, who were not yet \\nexhibiting symptoms, board the planes and sit in the back, separated \\nfrom other passengers by plastic sheets about 10 feet tall.   The reversal was the latest chaotic turn in a two-week quarantine of the ship that has become an epidemiological nightmare.   Even\\n as the Americans were flying home and countries like Australia, Canada \\nand South Korea were preparing to evacuate their own citizens, the \\nJapanese Health Ministry announced on Monday that 99 more cases had been\\n confirmed on the cruise ship, bringing the total to 454.   Among \\nthem was the third Japanese public health official to contract the virus\\n while tending to passengers and crew members aboard the ship, the \\nDiamond Princess.   The unstinting rise in \\ninfections a and the scramble to bring American passengers home, even \\nafter some were discovered to be infected a has led to tough questions, \\nand some withering criticism, about the handling of the outbreak aboard \\nthe ship, home to the largest number of coronavirus cases outside China.   aThe\\n quarantine on the ship ended up being an unprecedented failure,a said \\nEiji Kusumi, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases at Navitas \\nClinic in Tokyo. aWe should learn from this lesson that a quarantine on a\\n ship is impossible, and we should not repeat this in the future.a   Countries around the world are now struggling to figure out what to do with cruise ships during the coronavirus outbreak.   Another ship,  the Westerdam ,\\n was turned away from port after port in Asia until it was welcomed in \\nCambodia. The cruise line insisted that no one was ill and passengers \\nstarted heading home, yet one of them, an American woman, later tested \\npositive for the virus, worrying experts that the epidemic will get only\\n worse.   After the long quarantine in Japan, the U.S. authorities \\nhad strongly encouraged American passengers on the Diamond Princess to \\naccept the offer of a flight out. Getting them off the ship took days of\\n planning and hours of screening, checking passports and loading \\npassengers onto buses for the 40-minute bus ride from the port of \\nYokohama to Haneda Airport in Tokyo.   The goal was\\n to ensure that passengers who were symptomatic remain in Japan, \\nAmerican officials said. Medical experts examined American passengers on\\n the ship and determined that at least 328 of them could be evacuated. \\nMeanwhile, Japanese medical experts had done testing of the passengers, \\nbut did not have all the results ready .    In the end, 61 Americans remain on board, officials said.   Asked\\n why American officials began evacuating passengers without knowing \\ntheir test results, Dr. William Walters, managing director of \\noperational medicine at the State Department, told reporters on Monday \\nthat it was aunpredictablea when the results would come back.   The \\nAmericans were put on about 15 buses to the airport. Once it became \\nclear that some had the coronavirus, the State Department said, the \\ninfected passengers awere moved in the most expeditious and safe manner \\nto a specialized containment areaa in the rear of the planes.   aIn the isolation area, they posed no additional risk,a Dr. Walters said.   After\\n landing, the 14 infected evacuees went to hospitals for monitoring and \\ntreatment. Most ended up being flown to Omaha for medical treatment by \\nexperts at the University of Nebraska. Another five returning passengers\\n were also put into isolation because they had developed fevers.   The\\n remaining American passengers stayed at Travis Air Force Base in \\nCalifornia or Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, where they had landed \\nand where they will remain under quarantine for an additional 14 days.   When\\n one of the planes landed in California, a line of officials from the \\nmilitary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the \\nDepartment of Homeland Security greeted passengers with banners that \\nread aWelcome home.a   After being ushered through an isolation tent, they were assigned to apartments on the base.   aThey\\n have flown in specialists from across the country,a said one evacuee, \\nSarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, Calif. aItas a\\n phenomenal amount of resources. Iam kind of blown away.a   Epidemiologists\\n said American officials had made a difficult decision in allowing \\ninfected passengers onboard the charter flights.   aYou\\n donat want to expose anyone on the plane who hadnat otherwise been \\nexposed before on the boat,a said Dr. Allen Cheng, an infectious disease\\n specialist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.   Australia\\n is planning to take approximately 200 passengers off the Diamond \\nPrincess on Wednesday. Dr. Cheng said that Australia had decided that \\naanyone who is sick or becomes sick in the next 48 hours will stay in \\nJapan and stay in the hospital.a   With Australia and other \\ncountries preparing to help transport their citizens off the boat, the \\ncaptain told the more than 2,000 people still on board that the Japanese\\n health authorities could swab everyone for the coronavirus by the end \\nof Monday and begin letting guests leave the ship on Wednesday.   aThis\\n disembarkation will be an ongoing processa until Feb. 22, the captain \\nsaid in an onboard announcement. The captain said the cruise line was \\nacoordinating closely with your embassies.a   In a briefing on \\nMonday, Shigeru Omi, president of the Japan Community Healthcare \\nOrganization, said that Japan had made the right decision to put the \\nship in quarantine based on the information available when the ship \\narrived in Yokohama on Feb. 3. aAt that time, the international \\ncommunity was trying to contain the virus,a Mr. Omi said.   According\\n to the Japanese Health Ministry, at least 71 Americans on the ship were\\n infected with the coronavirus. Many of them remain in hospitals around \\nJapan.   John Haering, 63, a retired operations \\nmanager for Union Pacific Railroad who lives in Tooele, Utah, was taken \\nto a hospital in Chiba Prefecture last week with a fever and tested \\npositive for the virus. He said he felt stranded as he lay in an \\nisolation room.   His wife, Melanie, left on one of the charter flights.   aIam\\n happy for her that she got out of here and that sheas going to get some\\n attention in the U.S.,a said Mr. Haering, who retired in November and \\nwas about a third of the way through a six-month trip around the world. \\naBut at the same time Iam sad. You feel that loss of somebody leaving.a   Mr.\\n Haering, who said that he no longer had any symptoms or a fever but \\nthat a CT scan showed signs of pneumonia, was not sure how much longer \\nhe would have to stay.   aThey did swab me today again, and Iall get\\n my test back tomorrow,a he said. aI asked the doctor if the swab shows \\nthat Iam negative, and he just shook his head and said, aI donat know.a \\nThereas a lot of stuff that they donat know.a   Mr. Haering said he \\nhad not heard from anyone at Princess Cruises, the company that operates\\n the Diamond Princess, since he arrived at the hospital. Until Sunday, \\nhe had not heard from anyone at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, either.

Experts  are divided on how much protection a regular surgical mask, or even a scarf, can provide \\n for people who arenat yet sick. The W.H.O. and C.D.C. say that unless \\nyouare already sick, or caring for someone who is, wearing a face mask \\nisnat necessary.

Just\\n 104 Indonesians have been tested out of a population of 270 million, \\ndespite neighbouring countries including Australia reporting multiple \\ncases.

In\\n the smoky, gray haze of the morning, it\\'s hard to make out exactly what\\n Matt Roberts\\' camera is capturing. Roberts, a photojournalist with the \\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation, keeps his lens focused on the road \\nas he rolls into the   fire-ravaged   town 55 miles west of Canberra, Australia\\'s capital. At the asphalt\\'s edge, blackened livestock carcasses lie motionless.   The grim scene,  widely shared on social media , is emblematic of the impact the 2019-20 bushfire season has had on Australia\\'s animal life. Some estimates suggest  \"many, many billions\" of animals have been killed , populations of  endemic insects  could be crippled and, as ash washes into riverways,  marine life will be severely impacted . The scale of the bushfires is so massive, scientists are unlikely to know the impact on wildlife for many years.   But\\n even before bushfires roared across the country, Australia\\'s unique \\nnative animals were in a dire fight for survival. Habitat destruction, \\ninvasive species, hunting and climate change have conspired against \\nthem. Populations of native fauna are plummeting or disappearing \\naltogether, leaving Australia with an unenviable record: It has the \\nhighest rate of mammal extinctions in the world.   A large share of \\nAustralia\\'s extinctions have involved marsupials -- the class of mammals\\n that includes the nation\\'s iconic kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and \\nwombats. A century ago, the   Tasmanian tiger  \\n still padded quietly through Australia\\'s forests. The desert \\nrat-kangaroo hopped across the clay pans of the outback, sheltering from\\n the sun in dug-out nests.   Now they\\'re gone.   Australia\\'s 2019-20 bushfire season has been devastating for wildlife.   In\\n a search for answers to the extinction crisis, researchers are turning \\nto one lesser-known species, small enough to fit in the palm of your \\nhand: the fat-tailed dunnart. The carnivorous mouse-like marsupial, no \\nbigger than a golf ball and about as heavy as a toothbrush, has a tiny \\nsnout, dark, bulbous eyes and, unsurprisingly, a fat tail. It\\'s   Baby Yoda   levels of adorable -- and it may be just as influential.   Mapping\\n the dunnart\\'s genome could help this little animal become the marsupial\\n equivalent of the lab mouse -- a model organism scientists use to \\nbetter understand biological processes, manipulate genes and test new \\napproaches to treating disease. The ambitious project, driven by \\nmarsupial geneticist Andrew Pask and his team at the University of \\nMelbourne over the last two years, will see scientists take advantage of\\n incredible feats of genetic engineering, reprogramming cells at will.   It\\n could even aid the creation of a frozen Noah\\'s Ark of samples: a \\ndoomsday vault of marsupial cells, suspended in time, to preserve \\ngenetic diversity and help prevent further decline, bringing species \\nback from the brink of extinction.   If that sounds far-fetched, it isn\\'t. In fact, it\\'s already happening.   Creating\\n a reliable marsupial model organism is a long-held dream for Australian\\n geneticists, stretching back to research pioneered by famed \\nstatistician Ronald Fisher in the mid-20th century. To understand why \\nthe model is so important, we need to look at the lab mouse, a staple of\\n science laboratories for centuries.   \"A lot of what we know about \\nhow genes work, and how genes work with each other, comes from the \\nmouse,\" says Jenny Graves, a geneticist at La Trobe University in \\nVictoria, Australia, who has worked with marsupials for five decades.   The mouse is an indispensable model organism that shares many genetic similarities with humans. It has been key in   understanding basic human biology, testing new medicines  \\n and unraveling the mysteries of how our brains work. Mice form such a \\ncritical part of the scientific endeavor because they breed quickly, \\nhave large litters, and are cheap to house, feed and maintain.\\xa0   The lab mouse has been indispensable in understanding physiology, biology and genetics.   In\\n the 1970s, scientists developed a method to insert new genes into mice.\\n After a decade of refinement, these genetically modified mice (known as\\n \"transgenic mice\") provided novel ways to study how genes function. You\\n could add a gene, turning its expression up to 11, or delete a gene \\nentirely, shutting it off. Scientists had a powerful tool to discover \\nwhich genes performed the critical work in reproduction, development and\\n maturation.   The same capability does not exist for marsupials. \\n\"At the moment, we don\\'t have any way of manipulating genes in a devil \\nor a kangaroo or a possum,\" says Graves. Without this capability, it\\'s \\ndifficult to answer more pointed questions about marsupial genes and how\\n they compare with mammal genes, like those of mice and humans.   So\\n far, two marsupial species -- the Tammar wallaby and the American \\nopossum  -- have been front and center of research efforts to create a \\nreliable model organism, but they both pose problems. The wallaby breeds\\n slowly, with only one baby every 18 months, and it requires vast swaths\\n of land to maintain.   The short-tailed opossum might prove an even\\n more complicated case. Pask, the marsupial geneticist, says the small \\nSouth American marsupial is prone to eating its young, and breeding \\nrequires researchers to sift through hours of video footage, looking for\\n who impregnated whom. Pask also makes a patriotic jab (\"they\\'re \\nAmerican so we don\\'t like them\") and says their differences from \\nAustralian marsupials make them less useful for the problems Australian \\nspecies face.   But the dunnart boasts all the features that make \\nthe mouse such an attractive organism for study: It is small and easy to\\n house, breeds well in captivity and has large litters.   \"Our little guys are just like having a mouse basically, except they have a pouch,\" Pask says.   Pask (front) and Frankenberg inspect some of their dunnarts at the University of Melbourne.   A stern warning precedes my first meeting with Pask\\'s colony of fat-tailed dunnarts.   \"It smells like shit,\" he says. \"They shit everywhere.\"   I\\n quickly discover he\\'s right. Upon entering the colony\\'s dwellings on \\nthe third floor of the University of Melbourne\\'s utilitarian BioSciences\\n building, you\\'re punched in the face by a musty, fecal smell.   Pask,\\n a laid-back researcher whose face is almost permanently fixed with a \\nsmile, and one of his colleagues, researcher Stephen Frankenberg, appear\\n unfazed by the odor. They\\'ve adapted to it. Inside the small room that \\nhouses the colony, storage-box-cages are stacked three shelves high. \\nThey\\'re filled with upturned egg cartons and empty buckets, which work \\nas makeshift nests for the critters to hide in.   Frankenberg reaches in without hesitation and plucks one from a cage \\n-- nameless but numbered \"29\" -- and it hides in his enclosed fist \\nbefore peeking out of the gap between his thumb and forefinger, snout \\npulsing. As I watch Frankenberg cradle it, the dunnart seems curious, \\nand Pask warns me it\\'s more than agile enough to manufacture a great \\nescape.   In the wild, fat-tailed dunnarts are just as inquisitive \\nand fleet-footed. Their range extends across most of southern and \\ncentral Australia, and the most recent assessment of their population \\nnumbers shows they aren\\'t suffering population declines in the same way \\nmany of Australia\\'s bigger marsupial species are.   Move over, Baby Yoda.   As\\n I watch 29 scamper up Frankenberg\\'s arm, the physical similarities \\nbetween it and a mouse are obvious. Pask explains that the dunnart\\'s DNA\\n is much more closely related to the Tasmanian devil, an endangered \\ncat-sized carnivore native to Australia, than the mouse. But from a \\nresearch perspective, Pask notes the similarities between mouse and \\ndunnart run deep -- and that\\'s why it\\'s such an important critter.   \"The dunnart is going to be our marsupial workhorse like the mouse is for placental mammals,\" Pask says.   For\\n that to happen, Pask\\'s team has to perfect an incredible feat of \\ngenetic engineering: They have to learn how to reprogram its cells.   To do so, they collect skin cells from the dunnart\\'s ear or footpad and drop them in a flask where  scientists can introduce new genes into the skin cell .\\n The introduced genes are able to trick the adult cell, convincing it to\\n become a \"younger,\" specialized cell with almost unlimited potential.   The\\n reprogrammed cells are known as \"induced pluripotent stem cells,\" or \\niPS cells, and since Japanese scientists unraveled how to perform this \\nincredible feat in 2006, they have proven to be indispensable for \\nresearchers because they can become  any  cell in the body.   \"You\\n can grow them in culture and put different sorts of differentiation \\nfactors on them and see if they can turn into nerve cells, muscle cells,\\n brain cells, blood vessels,\" Pask explains. That means these special \\ncells could even be programmed to become a sperm or an egg, in turn \\nallowing embryos to be made.   Implanting the embryo in a surrogate mother could create a  whole animal.    It took about 15 minutes to get this dunnart to sit still.   Although such a technological leap  has been made in mice , it\\'s still a long way from fruition for marsupials. At present,  only the Tasmanian devil has had iPS cells created from skin , and no sperm or egg cells were produced.   Pask\\'s team has been able to dupe the dunnart\\'s cells into reverting to stem cells -- and they\\'ve even made some  slight genetic tweaks in the lab . But that\\'s just the first step.   He\\n believes there are likely to be small differences between species, but \\nif the methodology remains consistent and reproducible in other \\nmarsupials, scientists could begin to create iPS cells from Australia\\'s \\narray of unique fauna. They could even sample skin cells from wild \\nmarsupials and reprogram those.   Doing so would be indispensable in\\n the creation of a biobank, where the cells would be frozen down to -196\\n degrees Celsius (-273AdegF) and stored until they\\'re needed. It would act \\nas a safeguard -- a backup copy of genetic material that could, in some \\ndistant future, be used to bring species back from the edge of oblivion,\\n helping repopulate them and restoring their genetic diversity.   Underneath\\n San Diego Zoo\\'s Beckman Center for Conservation Research lies the \\nFrozen Zoo, a repository of test tubes containing the genetic material \\nof over 10,000 species. Stacked in towers and chilled inside giant metal\\n vats, the tubes contain the DNA of threatened species from around the \\nworld, suspended in time.   It\\'s the largest wildlife biobank in the world.   \"Our\\n goal is to opportunistically collect cells ... on multiple individuals \\nof as many species as we can, to provide a vast genetic resource for \\nresearch and conservation efforts,\" explains Marlys Houck, curator at \\nthe Frozen Zoo.   The Zoo\\'s efforts to save the northern white rhino from extinction  have been well publicized . Other research groups have been able to  create a northern white rhino embryo in the lab ,\\n combining eggs of the last two remaining females with frozen sperm from\\n departed males. Scientists propose implanting those embryos in a \\nsurrogate mother of a closely related species, the southern white rhino,\\n to help drag the species back from the edge of oblivion.   For the \\nbetter part of a decade, conservationists have been focused on this \\ngoal, and now their work is paying off: In the \"coming months,\" the  lab-created northern white rhino embryo will be implanted in a surrogate .   Sudan, the last male northern white rhinoceros, was euthanized in 2018.   Marisa\\n Korody, a conservation geneticist at the Frozen Zoo, stresses that this\\n type of intervention was really the last hope for the rhino, a species \\nwhose population had already diminished to just eight individuals a \\ndecade ago.   \"We only turn to these methods when more traditional conservation methods have failed,\" she says.   In Australia, researchers are telling whoever will listen that traditional conservation methods are failing.   \"We\\'ve\\n been saying for decades and decades, many of our species are on a \\nslippery slope,\" says John Rodger, a marsupial conservationist at the \\nUniversity of Newcastle, Australia, and CEO of the Fauna Research \\nAlliance, which has long advocated for the banking of genetic material \\nof species in Australia and New Zealand.   In October,  240 of Australia\\'s top scientists delivered a letter to the government \\n detailing the country\\'s woeful record on protecting species, citing the\\n 1,800 plants and animals in danger of extinction, and the \"weak\" \\nenvironmental laws which have been ineffective at keeping Australian \\nfauna alive.   Institutions around Australia, such as Taronga Zoo \\nand Monash University, have been biobanking samples since the \\'90s, \\nreliant on philanthropic donations to stay online, but researchers say \\nthis is not enough. For at least a decade, they\\'ve been  calling for the establishment of a national biobank to support Australia\\'s threatened species .   \"Our real problem in Australia ... is underinvestment,\" Rodger says. \"You\\'ve got to accept this is not a short-term investment.\"   The\\n current government installed a threatened-species commissioner in 2017 \\nand committed $255 million ($171 million in US dollars) in funding to \\nimprove the prospects of 20 mammal species by 2020.  In the most recent progress report ,\\n released in 2019, only eight of those 20 were identified as having an \\n\"improved trajectory,\" meaning populations were either increasing faster\\n or declining slower compared to 2015.   A spokesperson for the \\ncommissioner outlined the $50 million investment to support immediate \\nwork to protect wildlife following the bushfires, speaking to monitoring\\n programs, establishment of \"insurance populations\" and feral cat traps.\\n No future strategies regarding biobanking were referenced.   Researchers believe we need to act now to preserve iconic Australian species like the koala.   In\\n the wake of the catastrophic bushfire season and the challenges posed \\nby climate change, Australia\\'s extinction crisis is again in the \\nspotlight. Koalas are plastered over social media with charred noses and\\n bandaged skin. On the front page of newspapers, kangaroos bound in \\nfront of towering walls of flame.   Houck notes that San Diego\\'s \\nFrozen Zoo currently stores cell lines \"from nearly 30 marsupial \\nspecies, including koala, Tasmanian devil and kangaroo,\" but that\\'s only\\n one-tenth of the known marsupial species living in Australia today.   \"Nobody\\n in the world is seriously working on marsupials but us,\" Rodger says. \\n\"We\\'ve got a huge interest in maintaining these guys for tourism, \\nnational icons... you name it.\"   There\\'s a creeping sense of dread \\nin the researchers I talk to that perhaps we\\'ve passed a tipping point, \\nnot just in Australia, but across the world. \"We are losing species at \\nan alarming rate,\" says Korody from the Frozen Zoo. \"Some species are \\ngoing extinct before we even know they are there.\"   With such high \\nstakes, Pask and his dunnarts are in a race against time. Perfecting the\\n techniques to genetically engineer the tiny marsupial\\'s cells will help\\n enable the preservation of all marsupial species for generations to \\ncome, future-proofing them against natural disasters, disease, \\nland-clearing and threats we may not even be able to predict right now.   Pask\\n reasons \"we owe it\" to marsupials to develop these tools and, at the \\nvery least, biobank their cells if we can\\'t prevent extinction. \"We \\nreally should be investing in this stuff now,\" he says. He\\'s optimistic.   In\\n some distant future, years from now, a bundle of frozen stem cells \\nmight just bring the koala or the kangaroo back from the brink of \\nextinction.   And for that, we\\'ll have the dunnart to thank.

Roberts, a photojournalist with the \\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation, keeps his lens focused on the road \\nas he rolls into the   fire-ravaged   town 55 miles west of Canberra, Australia\\'s capital. At the asphalt\\'s edge, blackened livestock carcasses lie motionless.   The grim scene,  widely shared on social media , is emblematic of the impact the 2019-20 bushfire season has had on Australia\\'s animal life. Some estimates suggest  \"many, many billions\" of animals have been killed , populations of  endemic insects  could be crippled and, as ash washes into riverways,  marine life will be severely impacted . The scale of the bushfires is so massive, scientists are unlikely to know the impact on wildlife for many years.   But\\n even before bushfires roared across the country, Australia\\'s unique \\nnative animals were in a dire fight for survival. Habitat destruction, \\ninvasive species, hunting and climate change have conspired against \\nthem. Populations of native fauna are plummeting or disappearing \\naltogether, leaving Australia with an unenviable record: It has the \\nhighest rate of mammal extinctions in the world.   A large share of \\nAustralia\\'s extinctions have involved marsupials -- the class of mammals\\n that includes the nation\\'s iconic kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and \\nwombats. A century ago, the   Tasmanian tiger  \\n still padded quietly through Australia\\'s forests. The desert \\nrat-kangaroo hopped across the clay pans of the outback, sheltering from\\n the sun in dug-out nests.   Now they\\'re gone.   Australia\\'s 2019-20 bushfire season has been devastating for wildlife.   In\\n a search for answers to the extinction crisis, researchers are turning \\nto one lesser-known species, small enough to fit in the palm of your \\nhand: the fat-tailed dunnart. The carnivorous mouse-like marsupial, no \\nbigger than a golf ball and about as heavy as a toothbrush, has a tiny \\nsnout, dark, bulbous eyes and, unsurprisingly, a fat tail. It\\'s   Baby Yoda   levels of adorable -- and it may be just as influential.   Mapping\\n the dunnart\\'s genome could help this little animal become the marsupial\\n equivalent of the lab mouse -- a model organism scientists use to \\nbetter understand biological processes, manipulate genes and test new \\napproaches to treating disease. The ambitious project, driven by \\nmarsupial geneticist Andrew Pask and his team at the University of \\nMelbourne over the last two years, will see scientists take advantage of\\n incredible feats of genetic engineering, reprogramming cells at will.   It\\n could even aid the creation of a frozen Noah\\'s Ark of samples: a \\ndoomsday vault of marsupial cells, suspended in time, to preserve \\ngenetic diversity and help prevent further decline, bringing species \\nback from the brink of extinction.   If that sounds far-fetched, it isn\\'t. In fact, it\\'s already happening.   Creating\\n a reliable marsupial model organism is a long-held dream for Australian\\n geneticists, stretching back to research pioneered by famed \\nstatistician Ronald Fisher in the mid-20th century. To understand why \\nthe model is so important, we need to look at the lab mouse, a staple of\\n science laboratories for centuries.   \"A lot of what we know about \\nhow genes work, and how genes work with each other, comes from the \\nmouse,\" says Jenny Graves, a geneticist at La Trobe University in \\nVictoria, Australia, who has worked with marsupials for five decades.   The mouse is an indispensable model organism that shares many genetic similarities with humans. It has been key in   understanding basic human biology, testing new medicines  \\n and unraveling the mysteries of how our brains work. Mice form such a \\ncritical part of the scientific endeavor because they breed quickly, \\nhave large litters, and are cheap to house, feed and maintain.\\xa0   The lab mouse has been indispensable in understanding physiology, biology and genetics.   In\\n the 1970s, scientists developed a method to insert new genes into mice.\\n After a decade of refinement, these genetically modified mice (known as\\n \"transgenic mice\") provided novel ways to study how genes function. You\\n could add a gene, turning its expression up to 11, or delete a gene \\nentirely, shutting it off. Scientists had a powerful tool to discover \\nwhich genes performed the critical work in reproduction, development and\\n maturation.   The same capability does not exist for marsupials. \\n\"At the moment, we don\\'t have any way of manipulating genes in a devil \\nor a kangaroo or a possum,\" says Graves. Without this capability, it\\'s \\ndifficult to answer more pointed questions about marsupial genes and how\\n they compare with mammal genes, like those of mice and humans.   So\\n far, two marsupial species -- the Tammar wallaby and the American \\nopossum  -- have been front and center of research efforts to create a \\nreliable model organism, but they both pose problems. The wallaby breeds\\n slowly, with only one baby every 18 months, and it requires vast swaths\\n of land to maintain.   The short-tailed opossum might prove an even\\n more complicated case. Pask, the marsupial geneticist, says the small \\nSouth American marsupial is prone to eating its young, and breeding \\nrequires researchers to sift through hours of video footage, looking for\\n who impregnated whom. Pask also makes a patriotic jab (\"they\\'re \\nAmerican so we don\\'t like them\") and says their differences from \\nAustralian marsupials make them less useful for the problems Australian \\nspecies face.   But the dunnart boasts all the features that make \\nthe mouse such an attractive organism for study: It is small and easy to\\n house, breeds well in captivity and has large litters.   \"Our little guys are just like having a mouse basically, except they have a pouch,\" Pask says.   Pask (front) and Frankenberg inspect some of their dunnarts at the University of Melbourne.   A stern warning precedes my first meeting with Pask\\'s colony of fat-tailed dunnarts.   \"It smells like shit,\" he says. \"They shit everywhere.\"   I\\n quickly discover he\\'s right. Upon entering the colony\\'s dwellings on \\nthe third floor of the University of Melbourne\\'s utilitarian BioSciences\\n building, you\\'re punched in the face by a musty, fecal smell.   Pask,\\n a laid-back researcher whose face is almost permanently fixed with a \\nsmile, and one of his colleagues, researcher Stephen Frankenberg, appear\\n unfazed by the odor. They\\'ve adapted to it. Inside the small room that \\nhouses the colony, storage-box-cages are stacked three shelves high. \\nThey\\'re filled with upturned egg cartons and empty buckets, which work \\nas makeshift nests for the critters to hide in.   Frankenberg reaches in without hesitation and plucks one from a cage \\n-- nameless but numbered \"29\" -- and it hides in his enclosed fist \\nbefore peeking out of the gap between his thumb and forefinger, snout \\npulsing. As I watch Frankenberg cradle it, the dunnart seems curious, \\nand Pask warns me it\\'s more than agile enough to manufacture a great \\nescape.   In the wild, fat-tailed dunnarts are just as inquisitive \\nand fleet-footed. Their range extends across most of southern and \\ncentral Australia, and the most recent assessment of their population \\nnumbers shows they aren\\'t suffering population declines in the same way \\nmany of Australia\\'s bigger marsupial species are.   Move over, Baby Yoda.   As\\n I watch 29 scamper up Frankenberg\\'s arm, the physical similarities \\nbetween it and a mouse are obvious. Pask explains that the dunnart\\'s DNA\\n is much more closely related to the Tasmanian devil, an endangered \\ncat-sized carnivore native to Australia, than the mouse. But from a \\nresearch perspective, Pask notes the similarities between mouse and \\ndunnart run deep -- and that\\'s why it\\'s such an important critter.   \"The dunnart is going to be our marsupial workhorse like the mouse is for placental mammals,\" Pask says.   For\\n that to happen, Pask\\'s team has to perfect an incredible feat of \\ngenetic engineering: They have to learn how to reprogram its cells.   To do so, they collect skin cells from the dunnart\\'s ear or footpad and drop them in a flask where  scientists can introduce new genes into the skin cell .\\n The introduced genes are able to trick the adult cell, convincing it to\\n become a \"younger,\" specialized cell with almost unlimited potential.   The\\n reprogrammed cells are known as \"induced pluripotent stem cells,\" or \\niPS cells, and since Japanese scientists unraveled how to perform this \\nincredible feat in 2006, they have proven to be indispensable for \\nresearchers because they can become  any  cell in the body.   \"You\\n can grow them in culture and put different sorts of differentiation \\nfactors on them and see if they can turn into nerve cells, muscle cells,\\n brain cells, blood vessels,\" Pask explains. That means these special \\ncells could even be programmed to become a sperm or an egg, in turn \\nallowing embryos to be made.   Implanting the embryo in a surrogate mother could create a  whole animal.    It took about 15 minutes to get this dunnart to sit still.   Although such a technological leap  has been made in mice , it\\'s still a long way from fruition for marsupials. At present,  only the Tasmanian devil has had iPS cells created from skin , and no sperm or egg cells were produced.   Pask\\'s team has been able to dupe the dunnart\\'s cells into reverting to stem cells -- and they\\'ve even made some  slight genetic tweaks in the lab . But that\\'s just the first step.   He\\n believes there are likely to be small differences between species, but \\nif the methodology remains consistent and reproducible in other \\nmarsupials, scientists could begin to create iPS cells from Australia\\'s \\narray of unique fauna. They could even sample skin cells from wild \\nmarsupials and reprogram those.   Doing so would be indispensable in\\n the creation of a biobank, where the cells would be frozen down to -196\\n degrees Celsius (-273AdegF) and stored until they\\'re needed. It would act \\nas a safeguard -- a backup copy of genetic material that could, in some \\ndistant future, be used to bring species back from the edge of oblivion,\\n helping repopulate them and restoring their genetic diversity.   Underneath\\n San Diego Zoo\\'s Beckman Center for Conservation Research lies the \\nFrozen Zoo, a repository of test tubes containing the genetic material \\nof over 10,000 species. Stacked in towers and chilled inside giant metal\\n vats, the tubes contain the DNA of threatened species from around the \\nworld, suspended in time.   It\\'s the largest wildlife biobank in the world.   \"Our\\n goal is to opportunistically collect cells ... on multiple individuals \\nof as many species as we can, to provide a vast genetic resource for \\nresearch and conservation efforts,\" explains Marlys Houck, curator at \\nthe Frozen Zoo.   The Zoo\\'s efforts to save the northern white rhino from extinction  have been well publicized . Other research groups have been able to  create a northern white rhino embryo in the lab ,\\n combining eggs of the last two remaining females with frozen sperm from\\n departed males. Scientists propose implanting those embryos in a \\nsurrogate mother of a closely related species, the southern white rhino,\\n to help drag the species back from the edge of oblivion.   For the \\nbetter part of a decade, conservationists have been focused on this \\ngoal, and now their work is paying off: In the \"coming months,\" the  lab-created northern white rhino embryo will be implanted in a surrogate .   Sudan, the last male northern white rhinoceros, was euthanized in 2018.   Marisa\\n Korody, a conservation geneticist at the Frozen Zoo, stresses that this\\n type of intervention was really the last hope for the rhino, a species \\nwhose population had already diminished to just eight individuals a \\ndecade ago.   \"We only turn to these methods when more traditional conservation methods have failed,\" she says.   In Australia, researchers are telling whoever will listen that traditional conservation methods are failing.   \"We\\'ve\\n been saying for decades and decades, many of our species are on a \\nslippery slope,\" says John Rodger, a marsupial conservationist at the \\nUniversity of Newcastle, Australia, and CEO of the Fauna Research \\nAlliance, which has long advocated for the banking of genetic material \\nof species in Australia and New Zealand.   In October,  240 of Australia\\'s top scientists delivered a letter to the government \\n detailing the country\\'s woeful record on protecting species, citing the\\n 1,800 plants and animals in danger of extinction, and the \"weak\" \\nenvironmental laws which have been ineffective at keeping Australian \\nfauna alive.   Institutions around Australia, such as Taronga Zoo \\nand Monash University, have been biobanking samples since the \\'90s, \\nreliant on philanthropic donations to stay online, but researchers say \\nthis is not enough. For at least a decade, they\\'ve been  calling for the establishment of a national biobank to support Australia\\'s threatened species .   \"Our real problem in Australia ... is underinvestment,\" Rodger says. \"You\\'ve got to accept this is not a short-term investment.\"   The\\n current government installed a threatened-species commissioner in 2017 \\nand committed $255 million ($171 million in US dollars) in funding to \\nimprove the prospects of 20 mammal species by 2020.  In the most recent progress report ,\\n released in 2019, only eight of those 20 were identified as having an \\n\"improved trajectory,\" meaning populations were either increasing faster\\n or declining slower compared to 2015.   A spokesperson for the \\ncommissioner outlined the $50 million investment to support immediate \\nwork to protect wildlife following the bushfires, speaking to monitoring\\n programs, establishment of \"insurance populations\" and feral cat traps.\\n No future strategies regarding biobanking were referenced.   Researchers believe we need to act now to preserve iconic Australian species like the koala.   In\\n the wake of the catastrophic bushfire season and the challenges posed \\nby climate change, Australia\\'s extinction crisis is again in the \\nspotlight. Koalas are plastered over social media with charred noses and\\n bandaged skin. On the front page of newspapers, kangaroos bound in \\nfront of towering walls of flame.   Houck notes that San Diego\\'s \\nFrozen Zoo currently stores cell lines \"from nearly 30 marsupial \\nspecies, including koala, Tasmanian devil and kangaroo,\" but that\\'s only\\n one-tenth of the known marsupial species living in Australia today.   \"Nobody\\n in the world is seriously working on marsupials but us,\" Rodger says. \\n\"We\\'ve got a huge interest in maintaining these guys for tourism, \\nnational icons... you name it.\"   There\\'s a creeping sense of dread \\nin the researchers I talk to that perhaps we\\'ve passed a tipping point, \\nnot just in Australia, but across the world. \"We are losing species at \\nan alarming rate,\" says Korody from the Frozen Zoo. \"Some species are \\ngoing extinct before we even know they are there.\"   With such high \\nstakes, Pask and his dunnarts are in a race against time. Perfecting the\\n techniques to genetically engineer the tiny marsupial\\'s cells will help\\n enable the preservation of all marsupial species for generations to \\ncome, future-proofing them against natural disasters, disease, \\nland-clearing and threats we may not even be able to predict right now.   Pask\\n reasons \"we owe it\" to marsupials to develop these tools and, at the \\nvery least, biobank their cells if we can\\'t prevent extinction. \"We \\nreally should be investing in this stuff now,\" he says. He\\'s optimistic.   In\\n some distant future, years from now, a bundle of frozen stem cells \\nmight just bring the koala or the kangaroo back from the brink of \\nextinction.   And for that, we\\'ll have the dunnart to thank.

China had 394 new confirmed cases on \\nWednesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, sharply down from \\n1,749 cases a day earlier and the lowest since Jan. 23.     That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 74,576.    The\\n new coronavirus emerged in the city of Wuhan, the capital of the \\ncentral province of Hubei, in December, having apparently been passed to\\n people from wildlife sold illegally in a market.    Just how cases \\nare diagnosed and confirmed has had a big impact on official tallies of \\ncases, and changes in the method have raised questions about the extent \\nto which daily tallies accurately reflect the state of the outbreak.    Initially,\\n authorities were using nucleic acid tests to identify the presence of \\nthe virus, but such tests require days of processing, and there were \\nalso shortages of nucleic acid.    So last week, Hubei introduced a \\nnew, quicker diagnostic method through computerized tomography (CT) \\nscans, which use X-rays, to reveal lung infections, and to confirm the \\npresence of the virus.    The CT scan method of diagnosis resulted \\nin suspected cases that showed signs of pneumonia, but did not test \\npositive for genetic traces of the virus, being counted as confirmed \\ncases of the coronavirus.    That led to a surge of more than 15,000\\n new coronavirus infections for Feb. 12, and sparked unfounded fears \\nthat the virus was suddenly spreading much faster.    But on \\nWednesday, the NHC said it was removing that category of clinically \\ndiagnosed cases from its criteria for confirmed cases, meaning 279 cases\\n would be removed from the Hubei tally.    The commission said the nucleic acid test was the preferred method of diagnosis.    As\\n a result, Hubei, which accounts for most of Chinaas infections, saw a \\nsharp drop in confirmed cases, as reflected in the data announced on \\nThursday, with 349 new confirmed cases tallied on Wednesday, down from \\n1,693 on Tuesday and the lowest since Jan. 25.    The clinical \\ndiagnoses were a astop-gap measure,a Wang Guiqiang, head of infectious \\ndiseases at Peking University First Hospital, said at a regular NHC \\npress briefing.    There is no longer a supply issue for nucleic acid tests as there was before, he said.    For\\n Hubei, even if the authorities restored the 279 cases that were \\nsubtracted from the tally, the number of new cases on Wednesday would \\nstill be at least 1,000 less than a day earlier.     Allen\\n Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at Monash University in Melbourne,\\n said he did not understand why cases diagnosed by different methods at \\ndifferent times had to be added or subtracted to tallies on other days.    aBest\\n practice would be to assign the cases to the date they are reported. \\nThis was also an issue with the large number of cases reported on Feb. \\n12,a he said.

Up \\nuntil now, most evidence for the oldest known human habitation in \\nAustralia comes from radiocarbon dating or optically stimulated \\nluminescence (OSL) dating, using samples of ancient charcoal, or \\nsediments from rock shelters.

Only six sites in southeast \\nAustralia have been definitively dated to older than 30,000 years, the \\nresearchers say a despite evidence from elsewhere in the country \\nsuggesting it could have been inhabited as far back as 65,000 years ago,\\n or even older.    Luckily, recent technological advancements in \\nan alternative technique called argonaargon dating could provide new \\nways of dating volcanic rock in the southeast landscape, especially when\\n coupled with interpretations of cultural knowledge, the authors \\nsuggest.   \"The oral traditions of Australian Aboriginal peoples \\nhave enabled perpetuation of ecological knowledge across many \\ngenerations, providing a valuable resource of archaeological \\ninformation,\" Matchan and study co-author David Phillips explain in an \\narticle summarising their findings.   \"Some surviving traditions \\nappear to reference geological events such as volcanic eruptions, \\nearthquakes, and meteorite impacts, and it has been proposed that some \\nof these traditions may have been transmitted for thousands of years.\"   In\\n the case of the now-extinct Budj Bim volcano, and another nearby \\ninactive volcano located 40 kilometres (25 mils) away, called Tower \\nHill, we now have a better estimate of just how many thousands of years \\nago their ancient eruptions happened, thanks to the argonaargon \\ntechnique.   In the new research, the team dated a sample from a \\nlava bomb hurled from the historic Tower Hill eruption, along with a \\nsample of lava flow from Budj Bim\\'s eruption.   The results suggest \\nthe eruptions may have been contemporaneous, with lava dated to 36,800 \\nyears ago (A+- 3,800 years) for Tower Hill, and 36,900 years ago (A+- 3,100 \\nyears) for Budj Bim.   Given Tower Hill\\'s eruption was the most \\nrecent comparatively, the researchers suggest its eruption age \"directly\\n constrains a minimum age for human presence in Victoria\".   That \\nconclusion is based on the existence of a lone stone axe a called the \\n\\'Bushfield axe\\' a which was previously discovered buried beneath\\xa0a \\nlayer of volcanic rock and ash from the eruption, and is therefore \\nconsidered to be evidence of contemporaneous human occupation in the \\narea.   As for whether the long-told oral tradition of Budj Bim \\ntruly chronicles these awesome, ancient volcanic outbursts, it\\'s \\nimpossible to be sure. Some researchers say we need to be \\ncautious\\xa0about how we interpret stories from so long ago.

So, does size matter in a \\ncollision?   This was sparked by a conversation with some friends \\nthe other day when I asked about whether crash ratings factored in their\\n thinking when buying a new car. One said, yes, but most said, no, and \\none even asked what ANCAP was.

But is it as cut-and-dried as all \\nthat?   Well, no. It isnat. Occupant safety in a collision comes down to a \\nrange of factors whether the vehicle is big or small, like the age of \\nthe vehicle, its active and passive safety, the engineering of its \\ncrumple zones and so on.   To get started, we looked at what the \\nMonash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC)had to saya|only it \\ndidnat have much to say on the matter. Rather, its authors looked at the\\n research around size and weight in a collision context and concluded \\nthat more work needed to be done before a definitive conclusion could be\\n reached.   Hereas some of what it summarised, aThe literature on \\nthe crashworthiness relationship between vehicle mass, size and safety \\nis rather ambiguous. There was general consensus by most authors that \\nbigger cars were inherently more safe than smaller ones in a collision. \\nHowever, trying to define this relationship more precisely from the \\nliterature is problematic, in part, because of the number of confounding\\n influences and definitional differencesa.   Okay. So, still no \\nclearer. What else did MUARC find? aIt was concluded in general terms \\nthat mass is probably a more important safety feature than size for most\\n car-to-car collisions, although there was a suggestion that size may \\npredominate more in rollover crashes and single-vehicle accidents \\ngenerally.a     Related Slideshow: 14 easy car hacks you should know (Provided by Photo Services)      \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n   From using toothpaste to clean headlights to fixing dents with a plunger, here are some hacks to care for your car.   If you want to make the hazy \\nheadlights of your car sparkling, use toothpaste. Apply the toothpaste \\non an old towel or a rag and rub it on the surface and before you know \\nit, your dingy-looking headlight will be shining again.   Do you cringe each time you open the \\ncar door inside the garage because there just isnat enough space? Fret \\nnot. Protect the door (and the wall) with a swimming pool noodle. Halve \\nthe noodle lengthwise and stick it to the wall; the foam will cushion \\nthe impact of the door and make sure there are no more dings (or dents).   Constant exposure to grime, dust and \\nwater can damage windshield wiper blades. In case you havenat gotten \\naround to installing new ones and are unexpectedly caught in rain, cover\\n the damaged blade with a pair of womenas stockings and you are good to \\ndrive off again.   Scratches and chipped paint expose \\nthe metal frame of your car to rust and decay. To avoid this, use nail \\npolish of the same (or nearly) shade to touch up the damaged bits.   Here is another car hack you can \\naccomplish with nail paint. In the event of a broken windshield, paint \\nclear nail polish on both sides of the glass to stave off cracking until\\n you get it replaced. Remember, this only works with small cracks.   Did you wake up after a massive \\nsnowstorm to find your car covered under a blanket of snow? Instead of \\nspending time scraping ice off the windshield on a winter morning, just \\nspray a mixture of water (one part) and vinegar (three parts) and hey \\npresto, no more snow. You can also spray the solution the night before.   During summers, the intense heat can \\nheat up the steering wheel and seat belt. Here is a quick-fix solution \\nto help you in such situations. Simply spray some water on the steering \\nwheel and seat belt; evaporation helps in cooling the car interior.   A plunger may be a plumberas helper \\nbut it is just as useful to repair minor dents. All you have to do is \\nwet the dent and the plunger, and then push and pull until the damage is\\n undone.   Clean up the gummy mess left behind \\nby parking permits or bumper stickers by placing a wet newspaper on the \\naffected spot for 15-20 minutes. The newspaper softens the glue, making \\nit easier to wipe away the sticky residue.   On a hot day, chances are your car \\nwill end up like an oven if it is not parked in shade. However, instead \\nof blasting the air conditioning, try this trick to cool down the car. \\nRoll down one window and then open and close the car door in quick \\nsuccession five to six times. The action forces the hot air out of the \\ncar and the cooler breeze wafts in through the open window.   Another car trouble that snowy \\nwinters often bring is the freezing of car locks. Keep a water-less hand\\n sanitizer at hand and, when such a situation arises, apply some of that\\n solution on the key. The alcohol content in the sanitizer helps in \\nmelting the ice.   Keeping cars clean can be quite a \\ntask. Coffee filters a made of minute particles a soak up dirt pretty \\nfast, making car cleaning a somewhat easier task. Dab a few drops of \\nvegetable or olive oil on the coffee filter and wipe clean.   Though there are a variety of \\ncarriers and consoles in the market to provide in-car storage solutions,\\n that shouldnat stop you from putting your own creative spin. You can \\nhang a shoe organizer from the back of a car seat to help carry books or\\n bottles, or attach a mesh bungee net from the ceiling to hang your coat\\n or dress. To hold engine and motor oils, you can use a shower caddy.   When you are pressed for time, coffee\\n on the go is always a great idea. But is the condensation from the \\ncontainer leaving a mess in your car cup holder? Fret not. All you have \\nto do is place a silicone cupcake liner in the holder. The liner will \\nsoak up the condensation as well as guard your cup holders against dust \\nparticles.    15/15 SLIDES \\n   And then there was this gem MUARC stumbled across. aThe level of \\nrestraint has been shown to have a marked influence on the mass (size) \\nand safety relationship. One study reported that an unbelted driver in a\\n 2000kg car had the same amount of protection as a belted driver in a \\n1140kg car. It was further claimed that drivers of small cars gained \\nmore from being restrained than those of larger ones. It is too early \\nyet to confirm if there is any disproportionate benefit of driver \\nairbags by vehicle sizea.   So, there clearly hasnat been a lot done\\n in determining whether youare safer in a bigger than a smaller vehicle \\nin a collision, only thatas not exactly true. PM did some more digging \\nand found some good information. According to Michael Paine, Technical \\nManager at ANCAP, aGenerally speaking big cars will do better in a \\ncollision with a smaller car. This is a result of the physics of the \\ncrash, where the heavier object will experience a lower deceleration and\\n therefore lower forces on the occupantsa Michael says. aBut if your car\\n hits a larger stationary object, then thereas a lot more weight in a \\nlarger car, which means more crash energy to deal with.a   So, this \\nis making more sense, right. But thereas still more to it than simply \\nsaying bigger is better. And thatas largely because none of the safety \\ndata explores the effect of one vehicle on another vehicle. It merely \\nexplores the safety of the vehicle tested in relation to a stationary \\nobject. Sure, this is good for comparing apples with apples, as long as \\nyouare comparing small car results with small car resultsa|and \\nconsidering performance in a stationary collision event.   Researchers\\n at the Berkley Labas Environmental Energy Technologies Division looked \\nat acombined riska and thatas really what weare talking about when weare\\n asking whether bigger is better in a collision. Now, so you know, the \\nresearch conducted looked mid-1990s vehicles. One of the researchers, \\nTom Wenzel, said, a\"We focused on the risk not only to occupants of the \\nvehicle model in question in all types of crashes, but also on the risk \\nto the drivers of other vehicles involved in crashes with the model in \\nquestion.\"   In the report, the authors determined that SUVs werenat\\n any safer for their drivers than the aaveragea medium or large car and \\nnot much safer than many compact and subcompact cars.   Be that as \\nit may, bigger sometimes is abettera as previously explained by ANCAPas \\nMichael Paine. And, in 2009, the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, \\nthe US version of ANCAP, studied the effects of crashing larger cars \\ninto smaller cars, and concluded, aWhen a car crashes into a solid \\nbarrier, the outcome depends in part on the size of the front end. If \\none caras front end is long enough to crush twice as much as another \\ncaras in a barrier crash at the same speed, its restrained occupants \\nwill experience half as much force as the people in the smaller car \\nbecause it takes them twice as long to stop.   aWhen two cars going \\nthe same speed crash front to front, the outcome depends in part on the \\ncarsa relative weights. The heavier car will push the lighter car \\nbackward during the impact, which means the velocity change of the \\nheavier car will be much less than that of the lighter car. If the \\nlighter car weighs half as much as the heavier car, the forces on its \\noccupants will be twice as great.a   Yep, this is all pure physics. \\nBut weare still not talking about occupant safety. See, the development \\nof crumple zones and vehicle crash structures, airbags and even things \\nlike multi-collision braking can have a huge effect when weare talking \\nabout a bigger vehicle hitting a smaller one.   But thereas still \\nmore to the discussion. For instance, what if youare in an older, \\nheavier type of 4x4 and you hit a lighter more modern vehicle with a \\ncrumple zone. Who will come off better? The passengers in the heavier \\n4x4 or those in the lighter vehicle with a more sophisticated crash \\nstructure?   Well, we donat have to wonder because Fifth Gear, about\\n 10 years ago, did just that. It took a Series II Land Rover Discovery \\nand crashed it into a current-at-the-time Renault Espace (now, the last \\ngeneration model). The test was a slight offset collision at 40mph. The \\noccupants in the Espace were better off than those in the older \\nDiscovery. If you go by the claims that a heavier vehicle with a longer \\nbonnet (the Discovery) will perform better than that of something \\nlighter with a smaller bonnet (Renault Espace) then the Espace didnat \\nstand a chance.   And the result? Looking at the wrecked vehicles \\nyou could clearly see the Espaceas crumple zone had worked perfectly in \\nabsorbing the energy and impact while the vehicleas passenger cell \\nremained relatively intact with the front and rear airbags firing to \\nfurther protect the occupants and the impact deflected along the \\nvehicle\\'s sill, A-pillar and roof. In the Land Rover, however, the solid\\n main chassis member didnat budge sending the shock of the impact \\ncannoning through the rest of the vehicle causing the vehicle to crush \\nand deform as the Espace was forced around that rail and into the softer\\n parts of the Discovery. Indeed, the Discoveryas dashboard and steering \\nwheel ended up crushing the legs of the crash test dummy, the door \\ncreased and the passenger cell buckled.   That was head on, but what\\n about if one had been crashed into the other in a T-bone scenario? \\nWell, the IIHS tested for those sorts of things and found that older \\n4x4s with a ahighera physical structure posed a greater safety risk to \\nthose in a smaller car because the vehicleas main structure would act \\nlike a battering ram.   So, in our above example of the Discovery \\nand Espace collision, itas likely the Discovery would have had the \\npotential to do more damage in a side-on collision because of the height\\n of its main chassis rails, but the Discovery would still have suffered \\nin the collision because of its lack of energy absorption which still \\nwould have transferred onto the rest of the vehicle. The Espace \\noccupants would likely still have fared better due to the side airbags \\nand strength of the passenger cell and its ability to absorb and deflect\\n energy.   Recent tests by the IIHS have shown those driving modern \\n4x4s pose less risk to those in smaller cars, in side-on collisions \\nbecause the physical structure is now lower and stronger passenger cells\\n and side airbags have improved occupant safety.   So, while bigger \\nis sometimes better thereas more to it than that, like the age of the \\nvehicle, its passenger cell construction and strength, its \\nenergy-absorbing crumple zones, how the collision occurs, and so on. So,\\n never look at a heavily crumpled car and think it performed poorly, \\nlook at the passenger cell and how the impact affected the occupants, \\nbecause itas likely the vehicle crumpled to absorb energy and protect \\nthe occupants. So, is big better in a vehicle collision? No, not always,\\n but there\\'s still always a but and in this case it would be if an \\nolder, heavier 4x4 collided head-on with, say, a medium car. The 4x4 \\nwould likely ride up and over the bonnet of the medium car with its \\nstiffer chassis members battering the smaller vehicle.   But where \\nmodern vehicles are concerned the differences become much smaller. This \\nis a complicated topic and not so cut-and-dried as my mates would have \\nthought.   \\n            Microsoft may earn an Affiliate Commission if you purchase something through recommended links in this article\\n          ', \" Politician  Pauline Hanson \\xa0has slammed Chinese students for exploiting a legal loophole to sneak back into Australia amid the coronavirus outbreak.   She\\n called for universities to be liable if other students catch the \\ndisease, saying officials only care about 'money from foreign \\nstudents'.\\xa0   A travel ban is in place to keep Australians safe from the deadly disease, which has killed more than 2,000 people worldwide.   It\\n means travellers, including students, are not allowed to enter \\nAustralia if they have been in China in the previous 14 days.\\xa0   But\\n students from China are finding ways to work around the ban, brought in\\n by Scott Morrison, with 1,477 students flying in on Friday and Saturday\\n alone.   Thousands more are expected in the coming week, with \\nstudents arriving in Australia via transit countries such as \\nMalaysia.\\xa0   A family wearing face masks to protect themselves from coronavirus arrive in Brisbane Airport before the ban (pictured)   'If\\n any Australian kid catches coronavirus from any of these foreign \\nstudents that come here, will the university be held liable?', Ms \\nHanson, who is leader of One Nation and a senator for Queensland, said.   'We know that the universities in Australia are not for the Australian students.\\xa0   \\xa0'It is all for foreign students and they rely on that, that money coming into the country.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   'They\\n use it as back door to get their permanent residency to Australia and \\nthen they send their own kids out here to get the free education.\\xa0   'It is disgraceful what is happening.'\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   Pauline Hanson (pictured on Monday on Today) said there is a danger of Australians catching coronavirus from Chinese students   Passengers arriving in Australia are required under Australian law to identify themselves and provide certain information.   When you arrive in Australia from a foreign country, you are given a passenger card to fill in.   One of the boxes asks for the name of the 'country in which you boarded the flight'.   But this Chinese student wrote 'Hong Kong' in this section, despite starting his journey in China.   With this, he claims authorities did not question him and simply waved him through.   If he had written 'China' in the box, he would have been stopped and questioned.\\xa0\\xa0   Speaking\\n on Today on Monday morning, she said universities shouldn't be helping \\nChinese students get back to Australia to continue their studies.   Daily\\n Mail Australia exposed the worrying loophole earlier this month and \\nalerted the Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force \\nto the breach, but did they did not respond to requests for \\ncomment.\\xa0   One student bragged to friends\\xa0 about how he flouted the coronavirus travel ban, putting thousands in danger of contracting the deadly disease.\\xa0    He admitted to lying to officials by claiming he arrived from Hong Kong, when he in fact flew to Sydney from mainland China.   Ms Hanson\\xa0also used her Today appearance to\\xa0defended controversial comments about the horrific\\xa0 Brisbane  murder-suicide, saying 'these things happen'.   In a  crime \\xa0which\\n rocked Australia on Wednesday, Hannah Clarke, 31, was murdered by her \\nestranged husband along with her three young children.   Aaliyah, 6,\\n Laianah, 4, and Trey, 3, were burned alive by their own father on their\\n way to school after he poured petrol in their car and lit a flame.   But\\n Ms Hanson said the cowardly murders shouldn't lead to people \\n'bastardising all men' - saying Baxter could have been 'driven to it'.   'Don't bastardise all men out there, or women for that matter, because these things happen,' she said on Monday morning.   Speaking\\n about domestic violence murders, she added that: 'A lot of people are \\ndriven to this, to do these acts for one reason or another.'   The \\nkillings have led to calls for more protection for domestic violence \\nvictims, after Ms Clarke was emotionally, sexually and financially \\nabused by Baxter for years.\\xa0   Speaking on Today, Ms Hanson \\nsaid the murders have been in the news more than if it was committed by a\\n woman - and that Baxter may have been 'driven to it'.   Lloyd\\n and Suzanne Clarke (pictured), parents to Hannah Clarke, break down at a\\n vigil to remember their murdered daughter on Sunday   'You \\nknow, this has been for a week we have been in the news nearly every day\\n about this horrific tragedy,' she said on Today on Monday \\nmorning.\\xa0\\xa0   'But we don't hear much about it when a woman\\n has murdered her children by driving a\\xa0\\xa0car into a tree, she \\nthrew out a suicide note.\\xa0   'Or the woman who doused her husband with fuel and set him alight an said she was possibly driven to it.\\xa0   'Hopefully the family law inquiry will get to the bottom of it.'

This includes the CEPI initiative (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation).   So how easy it for a vaccine to be developed?

(Image: GETTY)     Professor\\n Turner said: aIn principle, it is relatively straight forward to design\\n and do preclinical testing of novel vaccine platforms, there are many \\nnew technologies being developed.   aThe difficulty is getting such platforms into humans. There are many steps before any vaccine is approved for human use.   aIt has to be shown to be safe, as well as effective.a   How\\n long it will take for a vaccine to be administered is a hard question \\naccording to Professor Turner, as it depends on any vaccine candidate \\nmeeting regulatory requirements for safety, efficacy and cost \\neffectiveness.    DON'T MISS    He \\nadded: aThere is the capacity to fast track experimental vaccines where \\nthere is a really public health need/public health imperative.   aThere is a recent example of rapid testing of a new Ebola virus vaccine.a   So who will be first to get the vaccine?

Photograph: A still from  Love Sex Aur Dhoka     A new research suggests that most women remain unhappy and stressed \\nabout their sex lives with at least one in five of them suffering from \\nfemale sexual dysfunction.   The study was conducted by the researchers of Monash University and was published in the journal  Fertility &amp; Sterility .   According to the study, half of young Australian women experience \\nsexually-related personal distress, with one in five women having at \\nleast one female sexual dysfunction (FSD).   The study conducted by the Women\\'s Health Research Program at Monash \\nUniversity has reported, for the first time, an overall picture of the \\nsexual wellbeing of Australian women between the ages of 18 and 39.   Results showed 50.2 per cent of young Australian women experienced \\nsome form of sexually-related personal distress. This relates to the \\ndegree of feeling guilty, embarrassed, stressed or unhappy about their \\nsex lives.   A concerning 29.6 per cent of women experienced sexually-related \\npersonal distress without dysfunction, and 20.6 per cent had at least \\none FSD.   The most common FSD was low sexual self-image, which caused distress \\nfor 11 per cent of study participants. Arousal, desire, orgasm and \\nresponsiveness dysfunction affected 9 per cent, 8 per cent, 7.9 per cent\\n and 3.4 per cent of the study cohort respectively.   Sexual self-image dysfunction was associated with being overweight, \\nobese, living together with partner, not married, married and \\nbreastfeeding.   Taking psychotropic medication (such as antidepressants), reported by\\n 20 per cent of surveyed women, had the most pervasive impact on sexual \\nfunction. The use of the combined oral contraceptive pill was not \\nassociated with any sexual dysfunction.   \"Sexual wellbeing is recognised as a fundamental human right. It is \\nof great concern that one in five young women have an apparent sexual \\ndysfunction and half of all women within this age group experience \\nsexually-related personal distress,\" said the lead researcher Susan \\nDavis.   \"This is a wake-up call to the community and signals the importance \\nof health professionals being open and adequately prepared to discuss \\nyoung women\\'s sexual health concerns.\"   The Grollo-Ruzzene Foundation Younger Women\\'s Health Study, funded by\\n Grollo Ruzzene Foundation, recruited 6986 women aged 18 to 39 years, \\nliving in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, to take part in the \\nstudy.   As a part of the study, all women completed a questionnaire that \\nassessed their sexual wellbeing in terms of desire, arousal, \\nresponsiveness, orgasm, and self-image. Participants also evaluated \\nwhether they had sexually-associated personal distress and provided \\nextensive demographic information.   Almost one-third of participants described themselves as single, 47 \\nper cent had a body mass index within the normal range, and nearly 70 \\nper cent had reported being sexually active in the 30 days preceding the\\n study.   Women who habitually monitored their appearance, and for whom \\nappearance determined their level of physical self-worth, reported being\\n less sexually assertive and more self-conscious during intimacy and \\nexperienced lower sexual satisfaction.   Professor Davis said if untreated, sexually-related personal distress\\n and FSD could impact relationships and overall quality of life as women\\n aged.   \"The high prevalence of sexually-related personal distress signals \\nthe importance of health professionals, particularly those working in \\nthe fields of gynaecology and fertility, being adequately prepared to \\nroutinely ask young women about any sexual health concerns, and to have \\nan appropriate management or referral pathway in place,\" added Davis.

Glen Eira city council, Port Phillip city council and \\nthe City of Stonnington have denied any wrongdoing in their management \\nof parking fine reviews, but said they had agreed to pay back any \\nreviewed fines issued between 2006 and 2016 or 2017 as a agesture of \\ngoodwilla.   The ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said all three councils \\nhad slightly different contractual arrangements with a firm called Tenix\\n to review contested parking fines.   In  a report tabled in Victorian parliament on Tuesday ,\\n Glass found that all three councils appeared to be in breach of the \\nInfringement Act 2006, which gives people who are issued with an \\ninfringement the right to ask the aenforcement agencya that issued the \\ninfringement to review its decision.   aThe legal issues have not \\nbeen tested in court; and not being a court, the Ombudsman cannot \\ndefinitively determine the lawfulness of the councilsa actions,a she \\nsaid. aBut I can express an opinion on whether an administrative action \\nappears to be contrary to law.a   The act makes no reference to private contractors, and Glass said the definition of aenforcement agencya is unclear.   But\\n correspondence from the Department of Justice and Community Safety, \\nwhich administers the act, said that reviews must be conducted by the \\nagency that issues the fine.   In a letter to the ombudsman, the \\ndepartment said: aThe departmentas communications, provided over many \\nyears, have consistently advised that an enforcement agency must \\ndetermine internal reviews internally, although contractors can provide \\nadministrative assistance as part of this process.a   Two other \\nMelbourne councils that had contacts with Tenix, Monash city council and\\n Kingston city council, last year announced they would pay back 46,000 \\nparking fines, worth a total of $4.9m, that were reviewed and upheld \\nbetween 2006 and 2016 after determining they had a alegal and morala \\nobligation to do so.   Monash city council had earlier written to \\nthe attorney general to request a retrospective amendment to the act \\nallowing for the use of private contractors, but the request was \\nrefused.   The issue was discovered by a lawyer who ran a website \\ncalled the afine defendera. From 2016, they wrote several letters to \\nMelbourne councils disputing the legality of the internal review \\nprocess.   Glass said it was likely that other councils and agencies\\n that are authorised to issue infringements in Victoria are also using \\nexternal contractors to conduct internal fine reviews.   Glass found\\n that Glen Eira council had outsourced its decision-making on internal \\nreviews to Tenix between 2006 and 2016, while Port Phillip and the City \\nof Stonnington had ain effect, rubber-stamped the contractor \\nrecommendationsa.   aCouncil officers could, in principle, review \\nthe evidence,a Glass wrote. aBut in practice, the speed with which \\nrecommendations were accepted gave no hint of independent assessment. \\nOne file review showed a council officer taking one minute to approve \\nrecommendations for 107 applications, or about half a second per \\napplication.a   The City of Stonnington said it arejects this \\nposition entirelya, saying it set clear parameters for internal reviews \\nand Tenix had no discretion.   aThe purpose of this arrangement was \\nto ensure that efficiency in this process was achieved,a it said in a \\nresponse included in the ombudsmanas report. aCouncil officers were \\nstill appropriately instructed to review Tenixas recommendations and \\nwere the ultimate and final decision makers in the process.a  ', ' Being\\n stressed about your sex life is not something uncommon, especially if \\nyou are from a country like India where sex or any discussion around the\\n topic of physical intimacy is still considered a taboo.

Under such circumstances, it\\'s no \\nwonder that young adults, particularly young women suffer from stress \\nrelated to their sex life. \\n\\n   In fact, a study conducted at the Monash University in Australia,\\n confirms this.

Japan has had 159 confirmed cases of the virus, many from those on the Diamond Princess which is still docked at Yokohama.   Hong Kong has suffered 81 confirmed cases and has shut its border with mainland China.   The Australian government says Aussies should take care when travelling to these areas by closely monitoring their health.   Despite recent outbreaks, Italy is still safe to travel to, according to DFAT.   Italy has 229 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including seven deaths.   Authorities\\n have introduced measures to restrict the use of public spaces and limit\\n travel in some parts of northern Italy where cases have occurred.   On Monday, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned the world must prepare for a potential coronavirus pandemic.

Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to \\nreproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses \\nare named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they\\n are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The \\ncoronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this \\noutbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on\\n Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory \\nSyndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed \\naround one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a \\n'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named \\nafter it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr\\n Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a \\nfamily of viruses that infect a wide range of different species \\nincluding humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild \\nanimals.\\xa0   'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there \\nwere only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of \\nthese cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has \\nbeen the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and \\nresult in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \\nand Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).\\xa0   'Coronaviruses\\n are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another \\nand that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new \\ncoronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet \\nknown.'\\xa0    The first human cases were publicly reported \\nfrom the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people \\nlive, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on \\nDecember 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had \\nbeen reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were \\ndeveloped for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The\\n first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 \\ncases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 \\npeople had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.\\xa0     Where does the virus come from?    According\\n to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from \\nbats.\\xa0Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the \\nsimilar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet \\ncats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came \\nfrom people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which \\nhas since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market \\nis officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being\\n sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, \\nporcupines and camel meat.\\xa0   A study by the\\xa0Wuhan \\nInstitute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific \\njournal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in \\npatients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found \\nin bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so \\nscientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a \\nmiddle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a \\nhuman. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr\\n Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not \\ninvolved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places \\nthe origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether\\n another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, \\nand possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host \\nmight have been.'\\xa0\\xa0    So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?\\xa0    Experts\\n say the international community is concerned about the virus because so\\n little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It\\n is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 \\nin an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus \\nwhich infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which\\n killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for\\n COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any \\nimmunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This \\nmeans it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across \\noften, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in \\nJanuary, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel \\nviruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which\\n circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most\\n seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in \\n1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand\\n fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate \\ncould be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.\\xa0   'My\\n feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this \\niceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The\\n illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, \\nmaking it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even\\n before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the \\nsaliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, \\nkissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live\\n on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning \\npeople can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,\\n people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in \\nWuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been \\nthere, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to \\nperson.\\xa0    What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once\\n someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 \\ndays, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still\\n be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, \\ntypical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever \\n(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from \\nthese without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In\\n a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those \\nwith long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an \\ninfection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with \\nfluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left \\nuntreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing \\nthat young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the\\n virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to \\nflu, but it is not clear why.\\xa0      What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?   \\xa0     Scientists\\n in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of \\nthe virus and released them to experts working around the world.\\xa0   This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   Examinations\\n have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known \\nas mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,\\n the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and \\nPrevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it \\nspread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and \\nto potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus \\nmight look different every time scientists analyse it.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   More\\n study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small \\nnumber of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were\\n various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed \\nseparately.    How dangerous is the virus?\\xa0\\xa0    The\\n virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death \\nrate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around \\n50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning\\n of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are \\ninfected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded \\ncases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they \\nnever even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more \\nserious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it \\nreally is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr\\n Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a \\nmission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only \\nshowing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be \\naccurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured? \\xa0   The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics\\n do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral\\n drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then \\ndeveloping and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge \\namounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and \\nit's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this \\noutbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National \\nInstitutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, \\nsay they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about \\ncoronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But \\nthis may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,\\n governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and\\n to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People\\n who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their \\nsymptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected \\npublic.   And airports around the world are putting in place \\nscreening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's \\ntemperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot \\nthose who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,\\n it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small \\nlikelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.    Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   The\\n outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by \\nthe World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new \\ndisease'.\\xa0   Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside \\nof Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't \\nactually spreading actively around the world.  \", \" Schools would be closed and mass public gatherings would be banned if the  coronavirus  escalated into a pandemic, infectious diseases experts say.\\xa0   Instead of commuting, Australians would also be made to work from home.   Hospitals\\n would also struggle to cope with an influx of patients - with modelling\\n predicting a massive shortfall of 'coronavirus beds'.   In a \\nworst-case scenario, Professor Raina MacIntyre - the head of biosecurity\\n at the University of New South Wales's Kirby Institute - said that mass\\n gatherings like sporting events and concerts would be banned as \\nchildren stayed home from school.\\xa0   Health experts are bracing for a scenario where up to 50 per cent of Australians get infected with the disease.\\xa0    Scroll down for video\\xa0    Schools\\n would be closed and mass public gatherings would be banned if the \\ncoronavirus escalated into a pandemic, infectious diseases experts say   School closures   Workplace closures   Mass gatherings cancelled   Voluntary quarantining   Source: Federal Department of Heath's  Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, May 2019    'Closure\\n of schools will be standard measures but may be implemented differently\\n in different states,' she told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.

'Businesses should start planning working from home arrangements,' Professor MacIntyre said.   The\\n infectious diseases researcher also feared hospitals would be \\noverwhelmed, forcing the postponement of elective surgery and an \\nexpansion of intensive care units.   She has released modelling \\nshowing tens of thousands of intensive care beds would be needed to \\ncope, going by the Chinese infection rate.   Should 50 per cent of \\nAustralians be infected\\xa0with coronavirus, in an extreme case \\nscenario, 650,000 intensive care beds would be needed as 1.8million \\npeople required hospitalisation in one year.

'If hospital beds run short, asking people with mild infection to stay home would be reasonable.   'We would likely see elective surgery delayed or rescheduled and reprioritisation of acute care.'   Coronavirus in China has a fatality rate of 2.3 per cent.\\xa0   Health\\n authorities in every Australian state are on high alert after the \\nAmerican Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned coronavirus \\nwas worse than first feared.   'Current global circumstances suggest\\n it's likely this virus will cause a pandemic,' the government \\nagency's\\xa0principal deputy director Dr Anne Schuchat told reporters \\non Tuesday night.   Should a pandemic occur, Australia's federal Department of Health warned hospitals were likely to be overrun.   'Demand\\n on primary health care will also increase, exacerbated by the need to \\nattend to patients affected by the changes in availability of services \\nat hospitals,' it said last year in its Management Plan for Pandemic \\nInfluenza.   A coronavirus pandemic would also require measures to prevent diseases outbreaks in aged care homes and prisons.\\xa0   Health\\n Minister Greg Hunt has flagged the possible cancellation of sporting \\nevents, like AFL and rugby league games.

Anna Skarbek ,\\n the chief executive of ClimateWorks, which is a non-profit advisory \\nbody that works within the Monash Sustainable Development Institute, \\ntold an ANU forum reaching net zero in Australia was entirely possible. \\naWe know the technology is available, it is about how to accelerate the \\nuptake,a she said.   aLooking just at the domestic economy, not the \\nexport economy, the technology mix is available for Australia to achieve\\n net zero emissions within the carbon budget the science requires for 2C\\n and for 1.5C.a   Skarbek a who is a former investment banker and a \\nfounding director of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation a said \\nachieving net zero would require dialling up progress on the known \\ntechnologies and avastly scaling up carbon sequestration through \\nforestry to buy us time to also scale up the research and development \\nfor the residual emissionsa.   aIf we want to achieve 1.5C instead \\nof 2C warming, which we know from the science, 2C is exponentially worse\\n than 1.5C, to do that, we canat afford any of these areas to be going \\nslower than they could,a Skarbek said.   aItas all in.a   The \\nwork updates research the organisation did five years ago on pathways to\\n decarbonisation, and Skarbek said the outlook had improved because of \\nrapid improvements in technology. The new analysis updates modelling for\\n Australia and it develops three Paris agreement-aligned scenarios.   The imminent release of the new analysis comes as  Laboras decision to sign on to a net zero target for 2050 \\n a the oppositionas first major climate policy decision post-election a \\nhas prompted the Morrison government to blast Labor for proposing a \\nlong-term target in advance of a roadmap to get there.   While the \\nCoalition has been attacking Labor, the government has not ruled out \\nadopting its own 2050 target, and Scott Morrison this week  declined to criticise the New South Wales government  for adopting a net zero position for 2050.   Morrison\\n told parliament he was happy to work with NSW on its ambition to hit \\nnet zero emissions by 2050 because the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, \\naha[d] a plana a although the specific plan the prime minister \\nreferenced on Tuesday ends in 2030.   The government will shortly \\nrelease its own technology roadmap, work that forms part of its \\ndeliberations on driving the transition to low emissions. Morrison has \\nsaid repeatedly he will not commit to any target beyond 2030 without \\nunderstanding the costs, and the impact on jobs.    More than 70 countries and 398 cities \\n say they have adopted a net zero position. Every Australian state has \\nalso signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and these commitments are \\nexpressed either as targets or aspirational goals. The Business Council \\nof Australia, which represents Australiaas biggest companies, also \\nargues Australia should  legislate a target of net zero emissions by 2050.     Rio Tinto announced on Wednesday \\n its globe-spanning operations will reach net zero emissions by 2050 and\\n it will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon \\nfootprint.

', \" Professor Ian Mackay works at the University of Queensland and specialises in virology   A top doctor has sensationally predicted everyone in Australia will fall victim to the\\xa0 coronavirus .\\xa0   Professor\\n Ian Mackay, from the University of Queensland, said it is unlikely the \\ndeadly virus will ever be contained and the world should prepare for the\\n worst.   The doctor's claim came as Prime Minister\\xa0 Scott Morrison \\xa0told\\n Australia a coronavirus pandemic was 'very much upon us' and detailed a\\n plan to stockpile medicines, create makeshift clinics and place \\naged-care homes into lockdown.   Just hours after Mr Morrison's \\nannouncement, an Australian who was on board virus-hit cruise ship \\nDiamond Princess was revealed to be in intensive care at a Perth \\nhospital suffering the most severe case the country has seen so far.   The 78-year-old was one of 223 Australians quarantined on the ill-fated ship in Japan, and was flown to Darwin last Friday.   Eight\\n Australians had been flown from the Diamond Princess cruise ship at \\nYokohama in Japan to a quarantine centre near Darwin (pictured), where \\nthey tested positive.   After tests showed the man had the \\ndeadly coronavirus, he was taken to his home state and is now in \\nintensive care at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   The\\n elderly man was evacuated with his wife, who does not have the virus, \\nand was said to be a in a 'serious but stable' condition.   Dr \\nMackay said it's unlikely the\\xa0COVID-19 virus would 'go back in its \\nbox' and predicated all Australians would eventually be infected.   'We're likely to have the virus Abecome what we call an Aendemic virus, or a virus that's just with us for life,' he told\\xa0 The Australian .   'We\\n already have four of these coronaviruses, mostly causing colds. We get \\nthem every year. They peak during winter but they still move around \\nAbetween us Aduring the rest of the year as well. So it's likely this \\nmight become one of those. \\xa0    Minister for \\nHealth Greg Hunt, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Deputy Chief Medical\\n Officer Professor Paul Kelly give an update on the coronavirus at a \\npress conference   'At some point in the coming months or \\nyears we're all going to get infected because we've all been infected by\\n these other endemic viruses.'\\xa0   The government's emergency \\nresponse plan, announced on Thursday, would allow federal and state \\ngovernments to contain the virus if there was a widespread\\xa0 \\noutbreak.   The World Health Organisation has not yet formally \\ndeclared a global pandemic, but Mr Morrison said Australia was operating\\n on the basis that there is one.\\xa0   The prime minister on \\nThursday instructed Health Minister Greg Hunt to identify 'gaps in \\ncapabilities' within Australia's state-based health services as \\nthey\\xa0combat the spread of the flu-like illness.   'We believe that the risk of a pandemic is very much upon us,' he told reporters in Canberra on Thursday.\\xa0   'We need to take the steps necessary to prepare for such a pandemic.'\\xa0   Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure   Prime\\n Minister Scott Morrison has said the risk of a global coronavirus \\npandemic impacting Australia is likely, releasing the government's \\nAustralian Health Management Plan on Thursday.   The government is currently at the 'Initial action stage' which includes:   * Health Minister Greg Hunt assumes powers under Biosecurity Act.   * Enhanced border screening measures and communications with incoming travellers.   * Medical stockpiles deployed to states and territories ready for use.   * Potential outbreaks investigated.   * National response coordinated with states and territories.   The\\n declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organisation or evidence \\nof a large-scale, sustained transmission of the virus in Australia will \\nmove the government to a 'Targeted action stage', which would see:   * Department of Health coordinating response from National Incident Room.   * Health services surging staff numbers.   * Items from the National Medical Stockpile distributed to health services.   * Consideration of any border or social distancing measures.   * Response could be scaled up or down based on spread of virus.   If\\n infection numbers reach a level that it can be contained by normal \\nhealthcare services, government moves to 'Standdown stage', which \\nincludes:   * Replenishing medical stockpiles.   * Resuming elective or non-urgent medical procedures.   * Monitoring for second wave of virus.   Mr\\n Morrison said that during the past 24 hours, the 'rate of transmission \\nof the virus outside of China is fundamentally changing the way we need \\nto look at how this issue is being managed here in Australia'.   'As a result, we've agreed today and initiated the implementation of the coronavirus emergency response plan,' he said.   'Based\\n on the expert medical advice we have received, there is\\xa0every \\nindication the world will enter a pandemic phase of the \\ncoronavirus.'\\xa0   Mr Hunt warned parliament the 'arc of the \\nvirus' continues to expand with confirmed first cases reported in \\nAlgeria, Brazil, Greece and Pakistan.

Stockpiling\\n by panicked shoppers has already seen shelves emptied in Italian towns \\nat the centre of the country's outbreak in the northern Veneto and \\nLombardy regions.\\xa0   Mr Cooper said it was too early for such \\npanic here but said Australians should start thinking about whether \\ntheir food cupboards can sustain them if the supply chain is broken.   'You\\n need to think about things that have a long shelf life: dried fruit, \\ndried foods, cereals, pasta will also last a long time,' he said.   'Packets of flour will also allow to make your own bread.'   The\\n survival expert said shoppers should be prioritising vegetables rather \\nthan protein, as the former should make up 80 per cent of our diet.   'Things\\n like root vegetables can be sun-dried and re-hydrated and last up to \\nsix months. I've tested it with bananas and fish as well,' he \\nsaid.\\xa0   Mr Cooper said even more important than food is keeping a supply of your own drinking water in case the supply runs out.   'No-one\\n is gonna die of starvation - it might get hard - but that should be the\\n least of your priorities,' he said.

But not even flights closer to home in comparatively \\n'safe' New Zealand are exempt with Qantas dropping some trans-Tasman \\nfares to $119.   Air New Zealand went even further with flights in \\nMarch costing just $69 on the Auckland-Melbourne leg and just $10 more \\nfor many others.   Flights across the ditch usually cost at least \\n$240 when booked about a month in advance, as is the case with these \\nflights.\\xa0   The\\n coronavirus outbreak means Australia will have 1.8 million fewer \\ninternational visitors in the first six months of this year compared to \\nlast year, a group representing tourism and transport companies says.   The\\n Tourism and Transport Forum estimates the number of foreign travellers \\nvisiting the country between January and June 2020 will be down 40 per \\ncent on the same period in 2019.   TTF chief executive Margy Osmond \\nsaid the peak industry body for the tourism, transport and aviation \\nsectors had produced economic modelling to show the effects of COVID-19 \\nif the virus was not able to be contained within the next three to six \\nmonths.   The TTF suggested there would be an average monthly loss in total tourism receipts of $2 billion beyond March.   'What\\n we are facing is a contracted visitor economy with significant losses \\nacross international visitation, tourism spend and employment in 2020 \\nand beyond,' he said.   'The economic impacts reflect the loss of \\ndirect tourism spend (tourism receipts) by the reduction in \\ninternational visitor arrivals and the estimated reduction in employment\\n within the visitor economy due to business slowing, [or] in some \\ninstances closure.'   These losses would be worse than the 2003 SARS\\n epidemic that slashed international visitors to Australia by 9.4 per \\ncent and cost $US30-50 billion.   Australia is even more reliant on \\nChinese tourism than in 2003 and that source has been reduced to zero by\\n the government's travel ban.   Australians are so fearful of travelling at all that Qantas and Jetstar are cutting capacity on domestic routes by 2.3 per cent.   Jetstar in response offered fared as low as $29 on major routes in a desperate attempt to limit the damage.\\xa0   One\\n of the best deals is flights from the east coast of Australia to Los \\nAngeles on Qantas at an unheard-of $564 return with similar prices for \\nSan Francisco.   Toronto and Vancouver can be visited for little \\nover $900 on some airlines and\\xa0Fiji Airways is running routes to \\nits home nation for $526.   Asia, where the virus has far more \\ncases, has been belted even harder with Qantas forced to cut 16 per cent\\n of its capacity there and Jetstar 14 per cent.   Some routes had the number of flights cut by half and those that are running are often using smaller planes.\\xa0   Virgin has canned its Hong Kong route altogether from Melbourne and will stop flying there from Sydney next week.   Outrageous deals are on sale as a result with flights that would usually go for hundreds down to double digits.   Air\\n Asia launched a blitz sale to Malaysia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and India\\n with flights to its base in\\xa0Kuala Lumpur going for just $89, and \\nBrisbane to Bangkok for $103.\\xa0   Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure   Travellers\\n said they feared not only catching coronavirus abroad, but being stuck \\noverseas by travel bans and cancellations, or being forced into \\nquarantine.\\xa0   Lisa Van Der Westhuizen, from Sydney, cancelled \\nher holiday with a friend to Japan after the government raised the alert\\n level.\\xa0   'I just thought it seemed a little bit riskya| and \\nI've got young kids (and) one of them, in particular, gets asthma when \\nhe is sick,' she told SBS.   'In my mind, I was thinking there would\\n be a chance it would escalate while I was over there and be impacted by\\n a quarantine period on the way home.'   Australians who have \\nalready booked flights or are thinking of doing so should check with \\nairlines and travel insurance companies to see their policies.   Many\\n insurers are not covering coronavirus claims at all unless the flights \\nwere booked many months ago before the virus became a 'known event' on \\nJanuary 23.

Mr\\n Morrison instructed Health Minister Greg Hunt to identify 'gaps in \\ncapabilities' within Australia's state-based health services to combat \\nthe spread of the deadly illness from China.   'We believe that the risk of a pandemic is very much upon us,' he told reporters in Canberra on Thursday.   Prime\\n Minister Scott Morrison has said the risk of a global coronavirus \\npandemic impacting Australia is likely, releasing the government's \\nAustralian Health Management Plan on Thursday.   The government is currently at the 'Initial action stage' which includes:   * Health Minister Greg Hunt assumes powers under Biosecurity Act.   * Enhanced border screening measures and communications with incoming travellers.   * Medical stockpiles deployed to states and territories ready for use.   * Potential outbreaks investigated.   * National response coordinated with states and territories.   The\\n declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organisation or evidence \\nof a large-scale, sustained transmission of the virus in Australia will \\nmove the government to a 'Targeted action stage', which would see:   * Department of Health coordinating response from National Incident Room.   * Health services surging staff numbers.   * Items from the National Medical Stockpile distributed to health services.   * Consideration of any border or social distancing measures.   * Response could be scaled up or down based on spread of virus.   If\\n infection numbers reach a level that it can be contained by normal \\nhealthcare services, government moves to 'Standdown stage', which \\nincludes:   * Replenishing medical stockpiles.   * Resuming elective or non-urgent medical procedures.   * Monitoring for second wave of virus.   'We need to take the steps necessary to prepare for such a pandemic.'\\xa0   Australian\\n Border Force is drawing up plans for extra measures at airports and \\nshipping ports to ensure travellers suspected of having the virus can be\\n quarantined or self-quarantined quickly.   'As this spreads we are \\ngoing to have to monitor the hotspots around the world for coronavirus \\nand overlay that with travel patterns,' ABF commisioner Michael Outram \\ntold Sky News.

Reporting\\n by David Stanway in Shanghai, Kate Kelland in London and Rocky Swift in\\n Tokyo; Additional reporting by Gabriel Crossley in Beijing; Editing by \\nGerry Doyle  ', \" Understanding\\n the principles of neuronal connectivity requires tools for efficient \\nquantification and visualization of large datasets. The primate cortex \\nis particularly challenging due to its complex mosaic of areas, which in\\n many cases lack clear boundaries. Here, we introduce a resource that \\nallows exploration of results of 143 retrograde tracer injections in the\\n marmoset neocortex. Data obtained in different animals are registered \\nto a common stereotaxic space using an algorithm guided by expert \\ndelineation of histological borders, allowing accurate assignment of \\nconnections to areas despite interindividual variability. The resource \\nincorporates tools for analyses relative to cytoarchitectural areas, \\nincluding statistical properties such as the fraction of labeled neurons\\n and the percentage of supragranular neurons. It also provides purely \\nspatial (parcellation-free) data, based on the stereotaxic coordinates \\nof 2 million labeled neurons. This resource helps bridge the gap between\\n high-density cellular connectivity studies in rodents and imaging-based\\n analyses of human brains.   We introduce a resource comprising curated results of retrograde tracer injections performed in the cortex of marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus ), made accessible through a web site ( http://marmosetbrain.org ).\\n This resource builds upon earlier demonstrations of the feasibility of \\nregistration of retrograde tracer data in primates to a common template,\\n and of sharing such data through online platforms  1 , 2  ,\\n but represents a distinct step towards cellular-level connectomic \\nanalyses of the primate brain. The present release incorporates \\nmethodological refinements which improve the accuracy of the attribution\\n of neurons to areas, as well as new datasets including the stereotaxic \\ncoordinates of neurons revealed by the experiments, estimates of the \\nwhite matter distances involved in each connection, and volumetric \\nrepresentations that enable integration with neuroimaging platforms. \\nThis functionality is made available through a dedicated analysis \\ninterface which enables quantification and visualization of results in \\nindividual cases, or aggregated by cortical area.   The \\ncontributions of neurons to perception, action, or cognition are \\nfundamentally determined by the connections they form with other \\nneurons. Complete maps of neuronal connections have been achieved for \\nsimple nervous systems  3  ,\\n but uncovering the organizational principles that govern neuronal \\nconnectivity in mammals is most realistically tackled at the mesoscopic \\nlevel  4  , by taking advantage of regularities in the patterns of connections formed by clusters of adjacent neurons  5  .\\n Although this is still a vast challenge, progress in informatics has \\ndramatically increased our capabilities to generate, store, and analyze \\nlarge datasets, which in turn enhance our understanding of brain \\nfunction through detailed computational models and analyses.   Presently,\\n there are several projects aimed at exploring connections throughout \\nthe mouse brain using grids of anterograde and retrograde tracer \\ninjections, which yield single cell resolution and information about the\\n direction of information flow  6 , 7  .\\n In parallel, the use of magnetic resonance imaging has allowed studies \\nof the principal axonal tracts in the human brain, but at a much lower \\nresolution  8  .\\n Integrating these two streams of investigation has been difficult, \\ngiven not only the different technologies used, but also neuroanatomical\\n differences, particularly with respect to the cerebral cortex. Several \\nsubdivisions of the primate frontal and posterior parietal cortex, which\\n are involved in higher-order cognition and sensorimotor integration, do\\n not exist as separate areas in rodents  9 , 10 , 11  .\\n Likewise, the primate occipital and temporal lobes comprise a large \\nnumber of visual and auditory association areas which have no clear \\nrodent counterparts  12 , 13  .\\n Thus, cellular-resolution datasets of connections in non-human primates\\n are necessary to bridge the gap between the gold standard tracer-based \\ndatasets obtained in rodent brains and our evolving knowledge of the \\nhuman brain.   The most extensive resources on cortical connections in non-human primates currently available are CoCoMac  14  \\n (an online platform based on meta-analysis of the literature) and \\nCoreNets (a collection of tracer injections in 29 areas, obtained with \\nconsistent methodology)  15 , 16  .\\n Both of these give access to information on the macaque monkey cortex, \\nbut are limited in terms of access to full datasets and integrated \\nfunctionality for analysis. A recently available dataset offers \\nhigh-resolution images of tracing experiments in marmosets, but no \\nfacility for quantification  2  .\\n Here we introduce a resource which significantly extends present \\ncapabilities, by giving open access to complete, curated datasets \\nobtained in marmosets, integrated with visualization and quantification \\ntools. Marmosets are small (~350ag) New World primates which have become\\n increasingly important for studies of cognitive function and \\ndysfunction, in part due to the relatively short developmental cycle, \\nwhich facilitates the development of transgenic lines  17   and studies across the life span  18  .   The\\n cerebral cortex is conceptualized to consist of areas characterized by \\ndistinct cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture, as well as different \\ndistributions of immunocytochemical markers and patterns of gene \\nexpression. Neurons in different areas are traditionally regarded as \\ndistinct in terms of connections and functions. In principle, the \\nclustering of neurons into areas simplifies the problem of detecting \\nregularities in cortico-cortical patterns of connections, and thus the \\ninformation flow; indeed, each of the neuroinformatics resources \\ncurrently available for connections in the mammalian brain is anchored \\non the notion of areas. However, the reality is far more complex. \\nFunctionally defined areas can be both histologically and connectionally\\n heterogeneous  19 , 20 , 21  , and single cytoarchitectural areas often prove, upon closer examination, to include connectionally distinct subregions  22 , 23  . Further, the histological limits of cortical areas are often very subtle  24  : for example, current estimates of the number of areas in the macaque cortex vary between 91  15   and &gt;150  25 , 26  .\\n These factors hinder integration of data raised by different groups, \\nand constitute obstacles for scientific progress in general: the \\ndifferent sets of nomenclatures and criteria, together with the fact \\nthat the primary datasets are not made publicly available, typically \\nmake\\xa0it impossible to analyze results retrospectively.   These \\nchallenges define the theoretical, analytical, and computational \\nrequirements for a resource aimed at facilitating research on the \\nconnectional architecture of the cortex. Primarily, such a resource \\nshould provide access to data in the form of directional connections \\nwithin a common stereotaxic space, using a consistent nomenclature to \\ndescribe the results both spatially and semantically (thus enabling \\nanalyses based purely on spatial distribution of connected cells, as \\nwell as those according to areas). The underlying data should be \\nprovided in full, and the resource should offer support for large-scale \\nmodels and simulations by enabling access to data in a programmatic and a\\n machine-mineable way  27 , 28  . The Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas ( http://marmosetbrain.org )\\n addresses these goals. To enable graph-based network analyses, this \\nresource includes tools for the quantification of connections between \\ncurrently recognized areas  29  .\\n In addition, it comprises the stereotaxic coordinates of labeled \\nneurons, thus opening new avenues of exploration that are purely \\nspatially based, enabling direct comparisons with results of \\nnon-invasive imaging methods, and allowing for future analyses that \\nincorporate new schemes of parcellation. We showcase the capabilities of\\n this resource by performing convergent area, injection, and single-cell\\n based tests of hypotheses derived from human neuroimaging experiments, \\nwhich postulate relationships between neuronal connectivity, distance \\nfrom primary sensory and motor areas, and affiliation to different \\nresting state networks  30 , 31  .   The Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas is accessible through the  http://marmosetbrain.org \\n portal. This resource provides online access to the primary \\nexperimental data, as well as the database of connectivity patterns \\nquantified according to the parcellation of the marmoset cortex  29   (see Supplementary Table\\xa0 1  for a list of areas and their abbreviations, and Supplementary Table\\xa0 2 \\n for a list of tracers used). The present release includes the results \\nof injections centered in 55 of the 116 currently recognized areas of \\nthe marmoset cortex, encompassing subdivisions of prefrontal, premotor, \\nsuperior temporal, parietal, and occipital complexes (Fig.\\xa0 1 ). A list of all injections is available in Supplementary Table\\xa0 3 , while comparisons between data obtained with different tracers are provided in Supplementary Figs.\\xa0 1  and  2 .\\n Across all injections, 1,968,388 tracer-labeled cells were mapped. The \\ndata were registered to a volumetric brain template through a pipeline \\nthat assures anatomical accuracy by taking into account \\ncytoarchitectural, myeloarchitectural, and chemoarchitectural \\ninformation to guide the registration process (see the aMethodsa \\nsection, 3D reconstruction and mapping procedure). This, and expert \\ncuration of the results, provides a high degree of spatial precision, \\nlargely circumventing the effects of individual variability.    a \\n The injections are illustrated in a two-dimensional (flat) map of the \\nmarmoset cortex, with the number of injections in each area indicated. \\nFor abbreviations of the areas, see Supplementary Table\\xa0 1 .

This part of the portal \\nprovides access to data on the strength and direction of connection \\nbetween areas (fraction of labeled neurons, extrinsic; FLNe: Fig.\\xa0 3 a) and the laminar origin of the projections (fraction of supragranular layer neurons; SLN: Fig.\\xa0 3 b). In addition, estimates of distances between cortical areas (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 3 ) can be obtained through the Quick links menu (Fig.\\xa0 4 a). Each column in the matrices (Fig.\\xa0 3 )\\n represents the connections of an area which received at least one \\ntracer injection, which can be arranged according to alphabetical order,\\n rostrocaudal coordinates, or hierarchical clustering (whereby areas \\ncharacterized by similar connectivity patterns appear adjacent to each \\nother). Alternatively, the connectivity data can be viewed as a graph \\n(Graph view) which highlights spatial relations (Fig.\\xa0 4a ).\\n Hovering the cursor over the intersection of two areas in the matrices,\\n or pointing at a graph edge, provides information about the cases in \\nwhich a specific connection was observed (Fig.\\xa0 4 b),\\n and clicking reveals further information, including an average \\nconnectivity profile, interactive visualizations of the data for each \\ninjection (Fig.\\xa0 4c ) and metadata (Fig.\\xa0 4 d).\\n Summaries of the data and detailed information (such as 3-d maps of \\ndistributions of labeled neurons compatible with neuroimaging platforms,\\n and the stereotaxic coordinates of each labeled neuron) can be \\ndownloaded for each injection separately, collated into a master \\nspreadsheet (Quick links menu, Fig.\\xa0 4 a), or accessed programmatically with a dedicated Application Programming Interface ( http://analytics.marmosetbrain.org/wiki/api ).    a  Connection strengths between areas (calculated as the mean FLNe).  b \\n The percentage of labeled neurons located in the supragranular layers \\n(SLN).

Rows\\n annotated with hatched lines on panel  b  correspond to areas in \\nwhich cells were not divided into supra- or infragranular due to the \\nlack of a visible layer 4 (i.e. the entorhinal cortex [Ent], piriform \\ncortex [Pir], amygdalopiriform transition area [APir], and subdivisions \\nof area 29 [A29aac]).

The\\n Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas allows the analysis of global \\nproperties of area to area connectivity, as well as finer-grained \\nanalyses based on the locations of neurons. This raises the opportunity \\nto test the often-made assumption that network properties which emerge \\nfrom analyses of interareal connectivity matrices  32 , 33 , 34  \\n reflect properties of the underlying cellular networks. As an example, \\nwe tested the hypothesis that neurons in primary sensory and motor areas\\n tend to receive shorter-ranged connections, in comparison with those \\nlocated progressively farther from their boundaries. This was initially \\nsuggested based on human functional connectivity, and later supported by\\n analyses of macaque data  30 , 31 , 35  , but not yet tested at the level of neuronal populations.   The first step was to test if marmoset data reflect the features observed in the macaque  31  \\n using an analysis based on areas. In this analysis, the distance to the\\n nearest primary area represents the distance from the injection site to\\n the border of the nearest primary area (for injections placed within \\nprimary areas this distance is 0). The connectivity distance of an \\ninjection is equivalent to the sum of the distances between the \\ncentroids of the target area and source areas, multiplied by the number \\nof labeled neurons found in the source area, and divided by the total \\nnumber of labeled neurons found in all source areas. A general linear \\nmodel (GLM) was used to assess the relation between the distance to the \\nnearest primary area (independent variable) and connectivity distance \\n(dependent variable). The results in marmoset (Fig.\\xa0 5 a)\\n support the view that there is a significant increase in the average \\nconnection length received by an area as a function of its distance from\\n the primary cortex (GLM,  F  3,143 a=a12.92,  p a&lt;a10 a3 ,  I2 a=a0.33, 95% CI [0.21, 0.45]). Averaging the results for all injections into the same area  31   yielded similar results (Fig.\\xa0 5 b). The above analyses were based on the set of primary areas used in studies of human and macaque cortex  31 , 35  :\\n V1, area 3 (A3a/A3b in the present nomenclature), the auditory core \\n(AuA1, AuR, AuRT) and F1 (A4ab, A4c). As shown in Supplementary \\nFig.\\xa0 4 ,\\n the relationship between average connection length and distance to \\nprimary areas is robust irrespective whether the analysis is based on \\nfunctionally defined primary sensory areas (e.g. including the gustatory\\n cortex, Gu, and excluding the motor cortex and rostrotemporal auditory \\narea, AuRT), or on koniocortex-type lamination (V1, AuA1, AuR, and A3b).    a ,  b \\n Analyses in which the locations of individual labeled cells are \\napproximated by locations of centroids of the corresponding areas, using\\n a general linear model (GLM) that incorporated covariates related to \\nlocations of areas (areas near the center of the cortical sheet being \\nexpected to show on average shorter connections than those located near \\nthe edges) and their different volumes (larger areas being expected to \\nshow longer average connections when intrinsic connections are \\nexcluded). Analyses based on individual injections ( a ) or averages of the results of injections in the same area ( b ) reveal similar trends.  c ,  d \\n Analyses using the locations of individual neurons (both intrinsic and \\nextrinsic). Here, the GLM also incorporated covariates to account for \\ninjection volume and the mean distance to every voxel annotated as a \\ncortical area.  e  Visualization of the results of the cell-based \\nconnectivity distance on a two-dimensional map of the marmoset brain. \\nThe green tones of each circle indicate results of the injection-based \\nanalysis, and background colors the averaged connectivity distance for \\ninjections in an area. Diagonal hatch indicates the primary visual area \\n(V1), areas A3a and A3b, the auditory core (AuA1, AuR, AuRT), and \\nprimary motor cortex (A4ab, A4c), and gray shading indicates areas where\\n no injections are available.  f ,  g  Comparison of average \\nthe length of supragranular (blue circles) and infragranular (red \\nsquares) afferents to the same areas. The ratio of the average length of\\n supragranular ( d  s ) and infragranular ( d  i )\\n afferents does not vary systematically with distance from primary \\nsensory and motor areas. The abbreviations of areas are provided in \\nSupplementary Table\\xa0 1 . Source data are provided as a Source Data file.   We\\n next tested if a similar relationship was observable if the exact \\nstereotaxic locations of the neurons are used, instead of approximating \\nlocations of labeled neurons with centroids of cortical areas. To avoid \\nbias due to the distances of cells in different layers of the cortex to \\nthe nearest white matter, the locations of individual cells (and \\ninjections sites) were projected to the nearest point on the \\nmid-thickness surface of the template prior to other calculations. Here,\\n the connectivity distance was estimated for each injection as an \\naverage length of simulated axonal tracts originating at the coordinates\\n of each cell labeled by a given injection and terminating at the center\\n of mass of the injection site. The pool of cells for each injection \\nincluded both extrinsic and intrinsic labeled cells, but excluded those \\nwithin a circular zone around the center of each injection. This zone, \\ndefined for each injection separately, was dictated by the volume of the\\n injection site and of the region immediately around it, in which \\nindividual neurons cannot be plotted reliably (the average radius of the\\n exclusion zones in our sample was 515aI 1/4 m; range 100a1100aI 1/4 m). The \\nresults (Fig.\\xa0 5 cae)\\n demonstrate that the relationship between connectivity distance and \\ndistance to the nearest primary area, first detected by an area-based \\napproximation, reflects a genuine property of the cellular circuits of \\nthe cortex (GLM,  F  3,139 a=a9.10,  p a&lt;a10 a3 ,  I2 a=a0.31, 95% CI [0.18, 0.44]), and that this relationship is present (Fig.\\xa0 5 f,\\n g) both in connections formed by supragranular neurons (putative \\nfeedforward connections) and infragranular neurons (putative feedback \\nconnections  15  ).   Further examination of the data presented in Fig.\\xa0 5 \\n reveals that prefrontal areas are quite heterogeneous in terms of \\naverage connection lengths, with rostral and medial prefrontal areas \\n(areas 32, 32V, and 46D on Fig.\\xa0 5 e)\\n showing increased emphasis on short-ranged connections relative to \\ncaudal prefrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal areas (e.g. areas 45, \\n47L, and 8aV). This is the case despite the data showing that in the \\nmarmoset, as in the macaque  36 , 37 , 38 , 39  ,\\n all prefrontal areas receive long-range afferent connections, which \\noriginate in areas of superior temporal, retrosplenial, posterior \\nparietal, and caudal orbital cortex (Fig.\\xa0 6 ).\\n The difference in connectivity distance (A32: 2.9amm, A32V: 3.1amm, \\nA46D: 4.2amm, against A45: 8.9amm, A47L: 6.3amm and A8aV: 5.9amm) is \\nlikely to reflect the closer link of caudal and ventrolateral prefrontal\\n areas to cognitive functions associated with the analysis of ongoing \\nsensory input, which is conveyed by long-range projections from the \\noccipital, superior temporal and posterior parietal regions  37 , 40 , 41  .\\n In comparison, the main functions of rostral and medial prefrontal \\nareas are more closely associated with internally generated states \\nincluding memory, value, and goals.   These are visualized in flat reconstructions available through the portal.  a ,  b  Results of retrograde tracer injection in medial prefrontal areas (A32V: area 32 ventral; A32: area 32).  c ,  d  Injections in rostral dorsolateral prefrontal areas (A46D: area 46 dorsal);  e a h \\n injections in caudal dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal areas \\n(A47L: area 47 lateral; A8aV: area 8a ventral; A45: area 45). Even \\nthough long-range connections are a characteristic of all prefrontal \\nareas, the medial and rostral areas ( a a d ) receive a higher proportion of their afferents from other prefrontal areas, in comparison with caudal areas ( e a h ). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.   The analysis illustrated in Fig.\\xa0 5 \\n also indicates that attributing single values to a cytoarchitectural \\narea is unlikely to capture the local diversity of cortico-cortical \\nconnectivity. For example (Fig.\\xa0 5 e), injection sites in area 47L tended to show a larger emphasis on shorter connections rostrally ( http://marmosetbrain.org ,\\n cases CJ71-FR [4.9amm], CJ181-DY [3.8amm]) than caudally (CJ73-FE, \\n7.9amm). The capabilities introduced by the present resource provide a \\nbasis for future refinements of cortical parcellation schemes in the \\nmarmoset, when used in conjunction with other anatomical and \\nphysiological criteria.   Large-scale\\n networks characterized by co-activation measured by fluctuations in the\\n BOLD signal have become an important concept in our current \\nunderstanding of structureafunction relationships in the mammalian \\ncortex  42  . These networks, which can be mapped in the resting brain, are selectively activated during different tasks  43 , 44 , 45  ,\\n and previous studies in non-human primates have established a \\ncorrelation between these and groups of areas which are preferentially \\ninterconnected at the cellular, monosynaptic levels  46 , 47 , 48  .\\n It has been hypothesized that the large-scale networks of the primate \\ncortex are organized in a nested structure, whereby those responsible \\nfor sensorimotor processing are characterized by predominantly \\nshort-range interactions with nearby areas, and those linked to \\nprogressively more abstract or multimodal processing show a \\nprogressively larger proportion of connections with distant areas. \\nMoreover, in this model areas that are unique to the primate brain would\\n be expected to show a predominance of long-range connections  30  .\\n To test this hypothesis, we quantified the ratio of labeled neurons \\nrepresenting local to distant projections in areas identified as \\nbelonging to different functional networks in the marmoset brain.   In\\n this analysis, local connections were defined as those originating in \\nneurons within 4amm of the injection sites (a value sufficient to \\ncomprise all intrinsic connections, as well as projections from adjacent\\n areas), whereas distant connections were those originating in cells \\nlocated further than 8amm from the injection sites. We conducted this \\nanalysis using areas corresponding to five functional networks \\n(Fig.\\xa0 7 a) identified in the marmoset by neuroimaging experiments  45 , 48   and by correlation of data available in  http://marmosetbrain.org  with human neuroimaging  47  . The main hypothesis was upheld (Fig.\\xa0 7 b):\\n the ratio of local to distant connections decreased from the primary \\nsensorimotor network (Pri), to a network formed by interconnected \\nhigher-order sensorimotor and premotor areas (HOSom), to a network \\nformed by frontal and posterior parietal visuomotor integration areas \\n(VisM), and finally to putative homologs of the human default mode \\nnetwork (cognitive control network, CON  45  , and apex transmodal network, APEX  47  ).\\n APEX and CON have been hypothesized to correspond to components of the \\nhuman default mode networks (DMNs A and B, respectively  48  ).\\n There was no significant difference between the mean ratio of local to \\ndistant connections between CON/DMN-B and APEX/DMN-A, although areas \\ncomprising the latter tended to be more homogeneous in their \\nconnectivity ratio. This was the case even considering injections \\nlocated relatively close to a primary sensory area (e.g. those in area \\nTPO, which is located ~2amm from the borders of the auditory core).    a \\n Flat reconstruction of the marmoset cortex, showing the location of \\ninjection sites attributed to five networks of areas, defined in \\nprevious studies  45 , 47 , 48  .\\n Pri (dark green): primary sensorimotor network (areas 3a, 3b, 4ab, and \\n4c); HOSom (light green): a network formed by interconnected \\nhigher-order somatosensory and premotor areas (dorsocaudal premotor area\\n [6DC], medial premotor area [6M], caudal ventral premotor area [6Va], \\ndorsal cingulate motor area [24d], and parietal area PF); VisM (yellow):\\n a network formed by higher-order visuomotor integration areas (lateral \\nand medial intraparietal areas [LIP and VIP], caudal subdivision of PE \\n[PEc], and putative subdivisions of the frontal eye field [8aV and 8C]);\\n CON (orange): cognitive control network (putative homolog of the \\ndefault mode network B, including frontal areas 8aD and 6DR, cingulate \\nareas PGM and 23b, and ventral parietal areas OPt and PG); APEX (brown):\\n apex transmodal network (putative homolog of default mode network A, \\nincluding areas 10, 23a, TPO, PGa/IPa, and the rostral part of TE3, near\\n the temporal pole).  b  Box plot (center line: median; box limits:\\n upper and lower quartiles; whiskers: 1.5A\\xa0interquartile range; \\nannotated points: outliers) of the ratio of the fraction of labeled \\nneurons located within 4amm of the center of the injection site (local \\nconnections) to neurons located &gt;8amm from the site (distant \\nconnections) following injections in the five networks (KaW: \\nKruskalaWallis  H  test: 29.8, pa&lt;\\xa010 a5 ). Statistical significance according to post-hoc Dunn's test:  p aa$?a0.05 (*),  p aa$?a10 a2  (**),  p aa$?a10 a3  (***). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.   We\\n report on a resource for quantitative analysis of cortico-cortical \\nconnectivity in a non-human primate (the marmoset monkey), made \\navailable to the scientific community via an online portal ( http://marmosetbrain.org ).\\n The resource is unique in several aspects compared to others presently \\navailable for the non-human primate brain. First, the data are provided \\nboth in an aggregated form (using traditional formats, such as FLNe and \\nSLN matrices linked to cytoarchitectural areas) and according to the \\nresults of each experiment (via three-dimensional and unfolded views of \\nthe brain, as well as downloadable files). Second, it provides access to\\n entire datasets through an online interface that allows the user to \\njudge the location of each labeled cell relative to the cortical \\ncytoarchitecture (areas and layers), as well as to assess the quality of\\n the underlying materials at points of interest. Third, the results have\\n been registered to a common template of the marmoset brain using a \\ncomputational pipeline which facilitates immediate comparison of results\\n obtained in different individuals, as well as combined analyses \\ninvolving many cases. This pipeline is distinctive in that it includes \\ndefined steps for expert validation of the registration results, aimed \\nat ensuring that the attribution of cells to areas was as accurate as \\npossible, based on current knowledge about the histological parcellation\\n of the marmoset cortex. In our experience, this careful curation is \\nnecessary when dealing with data obtained in a genetically heterogeneous\\n population of non-human primate brains, particularly in order to \\nminimize false positive reporting of connections due to registration \\nerrors. The estimation of distances based on biologically realistic \\nassumptions (simulated white matter tracts) also provides a significant \\nimprovement over previous approaches based on Euclidean or geodesic \\ndistances across the cortical surface. The potential of the resource as a\\n platform for discoveries has been already demonstrated by recent \\nstudies based on mining data on the spatial distribution of labeled \\nneurons  21 , 47 , 48   and analyses of network properties  49  . The present release significantly expands this capacity.   In\\n building the resource, we focused on retrograde tracers, which allow \\nvisualization of individual cell bodies relative to cortical layers. \\nThus, each cell location shown in  http://marmosetbrain.org \\n is akin to a quantum of connectivity, an approach that enables accurate\\n quantification with current technologies. This approach, which is in \\nline with earlier resources for the macaque brain  16  ,\\n is scalable to a complete cortical connectome, including information \\nabout the reciprocity of connections, based on future experiments to \\nencompass the entire cortex. In comparison, the use of anterograde \\ntracers imposes significant challenges for quantification, related to \\nvisualization and identification of synaptic terminals, and to \\ndistinguish those from axonal fragments on the way to their \\ndestinations. A similar resource incorporating anterograde data may \\nrequire future development of techniques for automated identification \\nand quantification based on high-resolution images (e.g. those available\\n at  http://marmoset.brainarchitecture.org ).\\n Some limitations remain regarding the quantification of labeled neurons\\n near the injection sites, where it is impossible to distinguish cells \\nthat formed projections from those which may have incorporated the \\ntracer by passive diffusion. Here, our approach was conservative, and \\nmost likely resulted in under-estimation of the actual numbers of \\nintrinsic connections.   One of the thorniest issues in neuroanatomy\\n is the assignment of a given location to a specific cortical area. \\nAreas with sharp, unambiguous histological boundaries are a minority, \\nparticularly among the association regions of frontal, parietal, and \\ntemporal cortex which experienced marked expansion in primate brain \\nevolution  24  .\\n This issue is not specific to the marmoset brain, as evident from the \\nfact that widely used parcellations of the macaque cortex differ  16 , 25 , 26   and that estimates of the number of areas in the human brain have continued to increase  50  .\\n Thus, unambiguous assignment of an injection site, labeled neuron, \\nrecording site, or activated voxel to an area is inherently uncertain. A\\n tangible example of this problem relates to the quantification of the \\npatterns of connectivity using matrices (e.g. Fig.\\xa0 3 ).\\n Such matrices provide convenient summaries of the data which are \\namenable to analyses (for example, based on graph theory), but should be\\n interpreted with the biological reality of uncertain borders in mind. \\nIn the present resource, labeled cells and injections are assigned to \\nspecific cortical areas based on registration to the reference atlas  29  ,\\n using a pipeline that ensured that clear cytoarchitectural boundaries \\nwere accurately represented (see section aMethodsa, aExpert-assisted \\nregistration to cortical areasa), but the definition of many other areas\\n is less certain. In cases where the registration suggested that an \\ninjection involved more than one area, we assigned it according to the \\nlocation of the injection barycenter. This decision was based on the \\nfact that changes in the patterns of cortico-cortical connections do not\\n occur abruptly at estimated borders, with gradual transitions of \\nconnectivity patterns often providing a better description  23 , 24 , 47 , 51 , 52  ,\\n and that variations of patterns of connections also exist within single\\n cytoarchitectural areas. Thus, excluding the data from injections that \\nnominally crossed borders would imply a false level of precision, while \\nresulting in selective reporting. Estimates of the percentage of \\ninjected voxels assigned to each area (Supplementary Table\\xa0 3 ) and of the volumes of cortical areas  1   are both available, enabling estimation of the effect of injections across borders  6   and statistical modeling based on multiple injections grouped in different ways  53  .   The\\n most important current limitation of the present resource is that it \\ndoes not yet cover several groups of areas (e.g. those in the \\nperirhinal, parahippocampal, insular, and anterior cingulate regions). \\nThis is being partially addressed by ongoing experiments which will be \\ngradually released through the portal, but a more permanent solution may\\n lie in a federated approach, whereby contributions from different \\nlaboratories can be integrated. Towards this end, the source code of \\nboth components of the Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas is released \\nunder the GPL license (see aCode availabilitya section), and the present\\n injections are indexed through other online resources (e.g.  http://marmoset.brainarchitecture.org , and  http://marmosetbrainmapping.org )  2 , 54  .\\n Another limitation is linked to the realities of experimental \\nneuroanatomy: the quality of the materials is variable due to factors, \\nsuch as unintentional damage to the tissue during surgery or \\nhistological processing or sub-optimal staining of histological \\nsections, which may limit the interpretation of data in specific \\nregions. We made a decision to show the material in its entirety, awarts\\n and alla, while including comments about known issues. We hope that \\nthis will allow users to make informed judgments on the suitability of \\nspecific materials to the analyses in mind while avoiding issues arising\\n from selective reporting. The adoption of additional automation steps \\nin the histological processing  2   will likely help address this limitation.   One\\n of the desirable features going beyond the integration of additional \\nmaterials would be the incorporation of probabilistic mapping of \\ncortical areas, based on a template that reflects individual variability  55  .\\n Presently the data are displayed and analyzed relative to the \\ncytoarchitectural areas of a single brain examined in great detail  29  , an approach which has limitations  1  .\\n In developing the resource we have incorporated steps where the results\\n of the registration were subject to validation by a human expert, but \\nthis is admittedly not as readily scalable as other steps. Registration \\nof the data to an average template of the brain, which incorporates \\nprobabilistic assignment of cortical areas to voxels, will facilitate \\nprincipled analyses of the data collected through a fully automated \\npipeline, at least in terms of assignment of confidence intervals to \\ninferences made based on the data. Another important development will be\\n better integration of the datasets released through the present \\nresource with those originating from magnetic resonance imaging, \\nincluding diffusion imaging  54   and resting-state connectivity  39  .\\n The precision of the non-invasive approaches for inference of neural \\nconnectivity has been questioned in terms of both sensitivity and \\nselectivity  56 , 57 , 58  . Direct comparisons with the extensive ground truth data released through  http://marmosetbrain.org  provide a unique opportunity both to refine algorithms for MR image analysis, and to understand its limitations.   A position paper  5  \\n which, in many ways, set the scene for the cellular-scale connectomic \\nefforts of the present decade, proposed that this type of work should be\\n based on experimental methods that are well-characterized, with \\nindividual steps for sample preparation, injection, histology, \\ndetection, and data analysis being stereotyped. The data collected from \\nsuch an effort must be made freely available to all researchers from a \\ncentralized data repository, including raw image data, processed summary\\n data, and metadata. The present resource provides the first large-scale\\n platform for a non-human primate brain that allows quantitative \\nanalyses based on these principles. It will hopefully provide a fertile \\nground for future studies involving cellular connectivity, including \\ncomparative analyses with the comprehensive datasets being generated for\\n the mouse and human brain using different techniques.   Release 1.0 of the Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas ( http://marmosetbrain.org )\\n includes the results of 143 injections of retrograde tracers in 52 \\nyoung adult (1.4a4.6 years, median age: 2.5 years) marmosets (31 male, \\n21 female). Detailed metadata for each animal is available via the \\nMetadata panel on the portal. All experiments conformed to the \\nAustralian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for \\nScientific Purposes, and were approved by the Monash University Animal \\nExperimentation Ethics Committee  19 , 20 , 21 , 41  . Intramuscular (i.m.) injections of atropine (0.2amgakg a1 ) and diazepam (2amgakg a1 ) were administered as pre-medication, before each animal was anaesthetized with alfaxalone (10amgakg a1 , i.m.) 30amin later. Dexamethasone (0.3amgakg a1 , i.m.) and amoxicillin (50amgakg a1 ,\\n i.m.) were also administered prior to positioning the animals in a \\nstereotaxic frame. Body temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygenation \\n(pO 2 ) were continually monitored during surgery, and when \\nnecessary, supplemental doses of anesthetic were administered to \\nmaintain areflexia. Small incisions of the dura mater were made over the\\n intended injection sites.   Six types of fluorescent tracers were used (Supplementary Tables\\xa0 2  and  3 , Supplementary Figs.\\xa0 1  and  2 ): fluororuby (FR; dextran-conjugated tetramethylrhodamine, molecular weight 10,000, 15% in dH 2 O), fluoroemerald (FE; dextran-conjugated fluorescein, molecular weight 10,000, 15% in dH 2 O), fast blue (FB, 2% in dH 2 O), diamidino yellow (DY, 2% in dH 2 O),\\n and cholera toxin subunit B (CTB, conjugated with either Alexa 488 \\n[CTBgr] or Alexa 594 [CTBr], 1% in PBS). The dextran tracers resulted in\\n bidirectional transport, but only retrograde labeling is reported here.\\n The tracers were injected using 25aI 1/4 l constant rate microsyringes \\n(Hamilton, Reno, NV) fitted with a fine glass micropipette tip. Each \\ntracer was injected over 15a20amin, with small deposits of tracer made \\nat different depths. Following the last deposit, the pipette was left in\\n place for 3a5amin to minimize tracer reflux. After the injections, the \\nsurface of the brain was covered with moistened ophthalmic film, over \\nwhich the dural flaps were carefully arranged. The excised bone fragment\\n was repositioned and secured in place with dental acrylic, and the \\nwound closed in anatomical layers. Postoperative injectable analgesics \\nwere administered immediately after the animal exhibited spontaneous \\nmovements (Temgesic 0.01amgakg a1 , i.m., and Carprofen 4amgakg a1 , s.c.), followed by oral Metacam (0.05amgakg a1 ) for 3 consecutive days.   Survival\\n times varied between 3 and 22 days (median: 15 days), after which the \\nanimals were anesthetized with alfaxalone (10amgaml a1  i.m.) and, following loss of consciousness, administered an overdose of sodium pentobarbitone (100amgakg a1 ,\\n i.v.). They were then immediately perfused through the heart with \\n500aml of heparinized saline, followed by 500aml of 4% paraformaldehyde \\n(PFA) in 0.1aM phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). The brains were \\npost-fixed in the same medium for at least 24ah, and then immersed in \\nbuffered PFA with increasing concentrations of sucrose (10a30%). They \\nwere then sectioned (40aI 1/4 m thickness) in the coronal (most cases) or \\nparasagittal (three hemispheres) plane, using a cryostat. One section in\\n five was mounted unstained for examination of fluorescent tracers, and \\ncoverslipped after quick dehydration (2aAa100% ethanol) and defatting \\n(2aAaxylene). Adjacent sections were stained for cell bodies (using the \\ncresyl violet stain, or the NeuN stain  59  ), cytochrome oxidase, or myelin (for protocols, see Supplementary Table\\xa0 2 ).\\n The remaining section in each series was stored in cryoprotectant \\nsolution in a freezer, to be used as a backup in the case of \\nunsatisfactory staining or damage during the processing of the \\nhistological sections. Hence, the spacing between adjacent sections in \\neach series was 200aI 1/4 m. Stained sections were scanned using an Aperio \\nScanscope AT Turbo system (Leica Biosystems), providing a resolution of \\n0.50aI 1/4 mapixel a1 . For cases with injections in the left \\nhemisphere, the resulting images were flipped horizontally to preserve \\nthe common format of all cases and to facilitate comparisons.   Sections\\n were examined using epifluorescence microscopes. Labeled neurons were \\nidentified using \\xa0A10 or \\xa0A20 dry objectives, and their \\nlocations within the cortex and subcortical structures were mapped using\\n a digitizing system attached to the microscope. To minimize the problem\\n of overestimating the number of neurons due to inclusion of cytoplasmic\\n fragments, labeled cells were accepted as valid only if a nucleus could\\n be discerned. This was straightforward in the case of DY, since this \\ntracer only labels the neuronas nucleus  60  .\\n In the case of tracers that label the cytoplasm (FB, FE, FR, CTBg, and \\nCTBr), the nucleus was discerned as a profile in the center of a \\nbrightly lit, well-defined cell body, which in the vast majority of \\ncases had an unmistakable pyramidal morphology.   We selected the Paxinos et al.  29  \\n stereotaxic atlas of the marmoset brain as the three-dimensional \\nreference space. The system of coordinates in this atlas is based on \\ncranial landmarks: the horizontal zero plane is defined as the plane \\npassing through the lower margin of the orbits and the center of the \\nexternal auditory meatuses, the anteroposterior zero plane is defined as\\n the plane perpendicular to the horizontal zero plane which passes the \\ncenters of the external auditory meatuses, and the leftaright zero plane\\n is the midsagittal plane. The Nissl-stained plates illustrated in the \\nPDF edition of the book (available at  http://marmosetbrain.org/reference ) were converted into a 3D template  1 , 61  .\\n This resulted in a volumetric image of a resolution of 40aAa500aAa40aI 1/4 m\\n (mediolateral, rostrocaudal, and dorsoventral, respectively) which \\npreserves the stereotaxic coordinates of the source atlas plates. The \\natlas parcellation scheme consists of 116 cortical areas arranged in an \\nontology comprising 22 groups. The same scheme has been also adopted by \\nother large-scale projects, such as BRAIN/Minds  62   and the NIH Marmoset Brain Atlas  54  , ensuring present-day interoperability.   To\\n register the results of individual experiments into the reference \\ntemplate in a systematic and standardized way a computational workflow \\nwas established. The pipeline  1  \\n computes a set of spatial transformations that allow expressing the \\nlocation of any object of interest in the experimental data, such as \\nlabeled cell body or location of the injection site, within a common set\\n of stereotaxic coordinates  29  .\\n This process enables analyses of the connectivity patterns obtained in \\ndifferent cases using a common spatial and semantic reference. Three \\nmain steps can be distinguished: The affine reconstruction step, the \\ndeformable reconstruction, and the combined, affine and deformable, \\nco-registration with the template image (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 5 CaE). The pipeline is based on the Possum 3D reconstruction framework  63   ( https://github.com/pmajka/poSSum ) and the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) software suite  64   ( http://picsl.upenn.edu/software/ants/ ).   First,\\n the images of the Nissl-stained sections were arranged in rostrocaudal \\norder and edited so that only parts representing the brain tissue of the\\n hemisphere to be reconstructed were preserved. The digitized locations \\nof the labeled cells plotted on the fluorescent series were then aligned\\n to adjacent Nissl sections (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 5 A).\\n For the purpose of the 3D reconstruction, the high-resolution images of\\n Nissl-stained sections are downsampled to 40aI 1/4 maAa40aI 1/4 m resolution to \\nreduce the processing time without significantly hampering the mapping \\naccuracy. The affine reconstruction step (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 5 C)\\n recovered the overall anatomical shape of an individualas brain \\nhemisphere. This was achieved by two alternating procedures: 3D \\nregistration of the reconstruction to the template, and 2D rigid \\nalignment of the sectionsa images to each other  1 , 63  .\\n This step restored the general shape of a hemisphere, but did not \\naddress noticeable transitions between consecutive sections caused by \\ntissue distortions, which naturally occur during the histological \\nprocessing. The deformable reconstruction step (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 5 D)\\n reduced these distortions by deformably coregistering an image of a \\ngiven section to a synthetic image obtained by averaging the images of \\nneighboring sections  63  .\\n This process produced a smooth reconstruction with a more natural \\nappearance, which also facilitated the subsequent registration to the \\nreference template.   In the last step, the reconstruction of a \\nhemisphere was brought into the space of the reference template \\n(Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 5 E,\\n F). This procedure mitigated the differences between the experimental \\nand the template hemispheres by morphing the reconstruction to match the\\n reference image, and minimized the influence of artifactual \\ndistortions, such as deformation of the surface due to the surgical \\nprocedures, or damage incurred during the extraction of the brain from \\nthe skull. Both the 3D reconstructions and the atlas image were \\nresampled to an isotropic resolution of 75aI 1/4 m and smoothed with a median\\n filter with a 1 voxel radius. During the affine step, the \\ncoregistration was driven by the Mattes mutual information  65  \\n (MI) image similarity metric. For the deformable registration two, \\nequally weighted, metrics were used: the cross-correlation coefficient  66   (CC) with a kernel size of 5 voxels, and the Point-Set Expectation  64  \\n (PSE) metric, which forced corresponding label maps to overlap (see \\nbelow). Overall, this process established a precise mapping between the \\nexperimental dataset and the template, which allows one to map the \\nsections of a specific animal into the stereotaxic space.   To\\n further increase the accuracy of the mapping (and, consequently, the \\nassignment of the individual labeled cells to cortical areas) an \\nadditional processing step was introduced to the workflow initially \\ndescribed  1  .\\n This procedure relied on guiding the registration to maximize the \\noverlap of corresponding cytoarchitectural areas across individual \\nexperimental brains and the template brain.   Two sets of label maps\\n were systematically outlined in each case, with each set given equal \\nweight in driving the registration. The first set (Supplementary \\nFig.\\xa0 6 A,\\n B) was drawn on images of Nissl-stained sections downsampled to 40aI 1/4 m \\nresolution, and highlighted the major morphological features of the \\nbrain, such as the ventral and dorsal banks and the fundus of the \\ncalcarine sulcus, lateral and medial banks and the fundus of the lateral\\n sulcus, hippocampus, lateral geniculate nucleus, and claustrum. In \\naddition, in the majority of the cases (45 out of 53), the outline of \\nthe entire cortex was delineated, thus ensuring that prominent \\nmorphological landmarks, such as the frontal, occipital, and temporal \\npoles were precisely captured.   The second collection of label maps\\n corresponded to the borders of individual cortical areas or aggregates \\nof areas (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 6 C).\\n These were traced on the set of sections used in the reconstruction by \\nan experienced neuroanatomist (M.G.P.R.), using the information \\navailable from the entire set of histological sections for an animal \\n(that is, the Nissl/NeuN, myelin, and cytochrome oxidase series). The \\nprocess of establishing which areas were to be included was carried out \\niteratively for each case in the following way: (1) the outline of the \\ncortex and the gross morphological landmarks were outlined, (2) the \\ncoregistration was carried out using a small number of histological \\nareas, and the results were inspected, and (3) depending on the outcome,\\n additional areas were added, and steps 2 and 3 were repeated until \\nsatisfactory results (i.e., no obvious assignment of labeled cells to \\nincorrect areas, as determined by histology) were achieved.   In \\nmost cases, the registration was based on 14 histological labels \\ndistributed across the cortex, which included: The primary visual (V1) \\nand somatosensory (A3b) areas, the middle temporal area (V5/MT), the \\ncombined extent of auditory core and belt areas (Aud), area prostriata \\n(ProSt), the entorhinal cortex (Ent), the piriform cortex (Pir), \\nparahippocampal area TH, the area 13 complex in orbitofrontal cortex, \\nthe area 3 complex in posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal area\\n 32V, dorsolateral prefrontal area 8b, the lateral intraparietal area \\n(LIP), and temporal area PGa/IPa. Each of these areas, or groups of \\nareas, could be unambiguously defined with high precision on the basis \\nof having sharp architectural borders. In many animals, additional areas\\n were used to drive the registration based on factors including markedly\\n different sulcal morphology in regions of interest containing labeled \\nneurons or injection sites, and persisting errors in the assignment of \\ncells to areas which were obvious during successive manual inspection \\nsteps. The actual number of areas used for this purpose varied between 2\\n and 22 in different cases, depending on the accuracy obtained with \\nsuccessive registration steps (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 6 C).   The\\n locations of cells and injection sites were mapped into the template \\nusing the computed set of spatial transformations (Supplementary \\nFig.\\xa0 5 G). Subsequently, they were assigned to a cortical area (or adjacent areas; see Supplementary Table\\xa0 3 )\\n based on the stereotaxic location of the corresponding voxel(s) \\nrelative to the atlas parcellation. As indicated in Supplementary \\nTable\\xa0 3 ,\\n 79 injection sites were entirely contained within estimates of a single\\n cytoarchitectural area, 41 were &gt;80% contained within an area (i.e. \\nwell within the estimated precision of the method used to reconstruct \\nboundaries), and 23 likely crossed borders. The assignment to an area \\nwas based on the voxel containing the injection barycenter, and \\nvalidated by an expert. Estimated percentages of the voxels in different\\n areas comprised by the injection sites are given in Supplementary \\nTable\\xa0 3 .   In\\n addition to being assigned to an area, labeled cells were divided into \\neither those above layer 4 (supragranular) or below it (infragranular) \\nby a procedure that involved manual delineation of the granular cell \\nlayer across the entire set of sections that contained labeled neurons \\n(Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 5 I).\\n Cells located in entorhinal cortex (Ent), piriform cortex (Pir), \\namygdalopiriform transition area (APir), and area 29a-c (A29a-c) were \\nexcluded from this assignment due to the lack of a visible layer 4. In \\nthe intermediate and medial sectors of the primary motor cortex (A4ab) \\nand dorsocaudal premotor area (A6DC) the interface between layers 3 and 5\\n was used for this purpose. The 3D locations, assigned areas, and \\nlaminar positions were stored in a database. Based on these data, the \\nconnectivity patterns obtained for each injection were quantified in a \\nway similar to the one used in other studies involving injections of \\nretrograde tracers  15   to assure compatibility and to enable cross-study comparisons.   Specifically, the strength of a directed connection to an injected area  A  from an area  B  was defined as the Fraction of Labeled neurons (extrinsic; FLNe), Eq. ( 1 ),    $${{\\\\rm{FLNe}}}_{{B}\\\\to\\n {A}}=\\\\frac{{\\\\rm{Number}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{of}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{neurons}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{projecting}}\\\\\\n {\\\\rm{to}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{area}}\\\\ {A}\\\\ {\\\\rm{from}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{area}}\\\\ \\n{B}}{{\\\\rm{Total}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{number}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{of}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{neurons}}\\\\ \\n{\\\\rm{projecting}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{to}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{area}}\\\\ {A}\\\\ {\\\\rm{from}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{all}}\\\\\\n {\\\\rm{areas}}\\\\ -{\\\\rm{neurons}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{identified}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{in}}\\\\ \\n{\\\\rm{area}}\\\\ {A}}$$    \\n                    (1)\\n                   which yields values ranging from 0 to 1 for each projection. The within area connections (i.e. from area  A \\n to itself) weights were not considered. Furthermore, based on the \\nestablished position with respect to the layer 4, the fraction of \\nneurons which originate in the supragranular layers (supragranular \\nneurons, SLN) of the source area was obtained according to Eq. ( 2 ).    $${{\\\\rm{SLN}}}_{{B}\\\\to\\n {A}}=\\\\frac{{\\\\rm{Number}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{of}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{supragranular}}\\\\ \\n{\\\\rm{neurons}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{projecting}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{to}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{area}}\\\\ {A}\\\\ \\n{\\\\rm{from}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{area}}\\\\ {B}}{{\\\\rm{Total}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{number}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{of}}\\\\ \\n{\\\\rm{neurons}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{projecting}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{to}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{area}}\\\\ {A}\\\\ \\n{\\\\rm{from}}\\\\ {\\\\rm{area}}\\\\ {B}}$$    \\n                    (2)\\n                   The FLNe and SLN values were calculated for\\n each injection separately. For areas where multiple injections were \\nplaced, an average FLNe value was obtained using the arithmetic mean. A \\ncorresponding average SLN value was obtained by first summing \\nsupragranular and infragranular neurons across injections in which a \\nspecific projection was observed, followed by calculating the SLN off \\nthe obtained totals  15  .   Distances\\n between cortical areas (interareal distances), as well as the distances\\n between individual cells and injection sites, were estimated by \\nmeasuring the lengths of simulated axonal tracts connecting these areas \\n(Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 3 ).\\n The procedure stemmed from the assumption that, at the mesoscopic \\nlevel, the brain organization follows the arrangement that minimizes the\\n wiring length, or more generalathe wiring cost  67 , 68  .\\n Therefore, we developed a computational model which assumes that \\nhypothetical axonal bundles linking any two given points in the cortex \\nminimize the wiring length by following the fastest (the least \\nexpensive, geodesic) possible trajectory through the white matter. This \\nwas accomplished numerically by assigning to each voxel of the 3D brain \\ntemplate a scalar parameter which expresses the ease with which a \\nsimulated fiber would traverse the said voxel. Fibers can pass through \\nthe white matter easily ( f  WM a=a1.0), while traveling across gray matter is difficult, yet still possible ( f  GM a=a0.05). On the other hand, reaching outside the brain is prohibited:  f  OUT a=a0.   To calculate the interareal distance matrix (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 3 D),\\n for each cortical area its centroid (defined as the maximum of the \\nsigned distance transform applied to the binary mask of a given area) \\nwas established. Subsequently, three-dimensional geodesic trajectories \\nconnecting each pair of centroids were calculated using the Fast \\nMarching  69   method implemented in the SimpleITK framework ( https://itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1FastMarchingImageFilter.html )\\n taking into account the imposed constraints. To mitigate numerical \\nerrors, for each pair of areas trajectories in both directions were \\ncalculated (e.g. for areas MT and V2, the paths from MT to V2 as well as\\n from V2 to MT were obtained). The length of each trajectory was \\nmeasured, and the distance between areas  i  and  j  ( d   i  j  ) was defined as the average length of paths in both directions, Eq. ( 3 ).    $${d}_{ij}=\\\\frac{1}{2}({d}_{i\\\\to j}+{d}_{i\\\\leftarrow j})$$    \\n                    (3)\\n                   The simulated tracts appear biologically plausible  70   (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 3 A,\\n B). For instance, those connecting areas in close proximity are \\nsuperficial to the interface between gray and white matter and form \\ncharacteristic U-shaped trajectories, while those linking remote areas \\npass through deeper parts of the white matter. The trajectories in the \\nopposing directions (i.e. from area  i  to  j  and from  j  to  i ) varied little in the vast majority of cases. The discrepancy (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 3 C)\\n was a$?0.046 for 95% of the pairs of areas and a$?0.129 for 99% of the \\ncases which illustrates the numerical stability of the method. \\nSporadically, however, due to the relatively large spacing between \\nconsecutive atlas plates (500aI 1/4 m), some numerical errors occurred \\ncausing trajectories in opposing directions to differ noticeably. \\nSpecifically, 15 pairs of areas have discrepancy larger than 0.3, the \\nmajority of which located in parts of the brain where the morphology \\nchanged rapidly in comparison with the spacing of the atlas plates. The \\ninterareal wiring distance matrix (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 3 D) comprises 6670 values ( n ( n  a 1))/2, where  n  is the number of cortical areas), distributed unimodally (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 3 E).\\n The average interareal distance of 12.5amm is biologically plausible, \\ncomparable to the half of rostrocaudal extent of the marmoset brain \\n(~30amm).   Finally, to eliminate bias resulting from choosing a \\nspecific relation between the ease of passing through the gray or white \\nmatter ( f  WM / f  GM a=a20) the analyses were repeated for  f  WM / f  GM \\n ratios ranging from 30 (a substantial difference between the gray and \\nwhite matter) to 1 (tissue classes indistinguishable). The results were \\nlargely independent for  f  WM aaa f  GM  \\nratios within a range that appears biologically relevant (10a30). Only \\nwhen the difference between the tissue classes started effacing, the \\naverage interareal distance dropped sharply (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 3 F).   The\\n primary experimental data, together with the results of the \\ncomputational workflow described above, have been made open to the \\npublic by the means of the  http://marmosetbrain.org  portal. Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 7 \\n provides an abridged overview of the portal architecture, supporting \\ninfrastructure, and its relation to the computational pipeline described\\n above.   The results generated by the data-processing pipeline (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 7 ,\\n bottom left) are of a heterogeneous nature, including images, text, and\\n tables, which calls for dedicated ways of handling each type in order \\nto allow online sharing. The voluminous high-resolution images of \\nhistological sections are converted to JPEG 2000 format and transferred \\nto the datastore. To facilitate responsive and fluent user experience \\nwhen displaying the images online, they are handled by a dedicated image\\n server (Djatoka,  https://sourceforge.net/projects/djatoka/ ) equipped with an elaborate caching and streaming mechanism to promptly access regions of interest at various magnifications.   Text and tabular data are stored in a master database (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 7 ,\\n bottom right) and subsequently refined into static datasets, such as \\nspreadsheets with quantified connectivity patterns, segmentation of the \\nsections into cortical areas, compiled sets of metadata, static \\nvisualizations (e.g. spatial patterns of labeled cells presented as 3D \\nimages), etc. These datasets are made instantly available to the web \\nserver, eliminating the necessity of generating them upon useras \\nrequest. Since the results are computed offline and only once throughout\\n the entire infrastructure, the possibility of a discrepancy is ruled \\nout and the chances of a failed request for obtaining a specific result \\nare reduced. This arrangement noticeably simplifies continuous updates, \\nexpansion, maintenance, and curation of the connectivity atlas.   From the useras perspective, the  http://marmosetbrain.org  portal consists of two components (Supplementary Fig.\\xa0 7 , top). The high-resolution section viewer employs the OpenLayers ( https://openlayers.org/ )\\n framework to combine the high-resolution images with the non-imaging \\ndata, providing views of the primary experimental data. The \\ncomplementary analytics interface provides the capability of exploring \\nthe quantitative results of the tracer injection experiments. Each \\ncomponent can be accessed either using a web browser or via a dedicated \\napplication programming interface (API), both offering access to the \\nsame range of data.

The woman returned to the  Gold Coast  from  Iran  and is now being held in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital, Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said.   The confirmed case takes the number of Australians infected with the virus to 24.   Coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure        Nine\\n people have coronavirus in Queensland, including three who were \\nevacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan.   'If you have been overseas in the last 14 days and feel unwell please immediately see a doctor,' Dr Young said.   Queensland health minister Steven Miles said people shouldn't panic about the coronavirus.   'Queenslanders\\n should be assured that our world class hospitals and our fantastic \\npublic health staff are ensuring Queensland is very well prepared for a \\npossible outbreak,' he said.   Australia is already buckling under \\nthe weight of the coronavirus epidemic - with the stock market in free \\nfall, supermarket shelves bare and a panic sale on flights.\\xa0   With\\n the world on the cusp of an unstoppable pandemic, experts warned every \\nAustralian could soon be struck down by the killer virus.   Families could soon see their supermarket bill balloon as worried households begin to stockpile food and medicines.\\xa0   The\\n Australian Securities Exchange has now fallen for the sixth straight \\nsession, shedding $221 billion - or 10 per cent - in just one week, \\nincluding $72 billion on Friday morning alone.   It comes as the \\nrespiratory virus infected more than 82,000 people worldwide - including\\n 24 in Australia - causing 2,804 deaths.\\xa0   The deadly strain, known now as Covid-19, originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\\xa0   The economic plunge threatened to get even worse after\\xa0 Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a coronavirus pandemic is 'very much upon us'.    Launching\\n an emergency plan on Thursday afternoon, he said the government was \\nidentifying 'gaps in capabilities' within Australia's state-based health\\n services.\\xa0   As residents prepare for the epidemic to hit, \\nwith 23 people already struck down on Australian soil, there is already \\nevidence of panicked stockpiling.    Travellers at Brisbane International Airport on January 29 (pictured)    Shocking photos emerged showing Woolworths shelves stripped of medicine, toilet paper and food staples.   Customers\\n were greeted with near empty aisles when they arrived at the \\nsupermarket giant's Bondi store in Sydney on Thursday night.   The \\ngrocery store appeared to be struggling to keep the shelves stocked with\\n paracetamol, toilet paper, tea, milk, pasta, oats and rice \\ncrackers.\\xa0   Speaking\\n to reporters in Canberra on Thursday afternoon, Mr Morrison confirmed \\nAustralia would operate as if coronavirus was already a pandemic.\\xa0   'There is every indication that the world will soon enter a pandemic phase of the coronavirus,' he said.   'And as a result, we have agreed today and initiated the implementation of the Coronavirus Emergency Response Plan.   'We\\n believe that the risk of a global pandemic is very much upon us and as a\\n result, as a government, we need to take the steps necessary to prepare\\n for such a pandemic.   'There is no need for us to be moving towards not having mass gatherings of people.\\xa0   'You\\n can still go to the football, you can still go to the cricket, you can \\nstill go and play with your friends down the street, you can go off to \\nthe concert, and you can go out for a Chinese meal.   'You can do \\nall of these things because Australia has acted quickly, Australia has \\ngot ahead of this at this point in time.\\xa0   'But to stay ahead of it, we need to now elevate our response to this next phase.'   Coronavirus fears wiped an incredible $72 billion off the Australian stock exchange on Friday morning.   It tumbled from a record closing high of 7,162 last Thursday to just 6,441 at 10am on Friday.   The dollar has fallen below 66 US cents for the first time in a decade.\\xa0   Indicating\\n that businesses are struggling, Air New Zealand slashed prices to \\nAustralia to just $69 on Friday morning in a bid to boost sales.   The\\n airline is offering $69 one way flights from Christchurch to Melbourne,\\n while fares for Auckland to Sydney and Brisbane will set Kiwis back \\n$79.   It'll cost passengers just $69 to fly from Christchurch to Melbourne one way, and $79 to fly into Brisbane.   The cheap airfares are available for travel from mid-March.\\xa0   Thanks\\n to coronavirus travel bans, Air New Zealand, Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin\\n Australia have reduced the amount of flights heading across the \\nditch.\\xa0   But they are lowering ticket prices to fill up the remaining planes.   There are currently 23 cases of coronavirus in Australia, eight of which originated on the doomed Diamond Princess cruise ship.   At\\n least 621 people on the ship tested positive for the virus, officially \\nnamed Covid-19, making it the biggest cluster outside China.   There were a total of\\xa0223 Australians quarantined on the ill-fated ship in the Japanese port of Yokohama.\\xa0   Worldwide, the virus has killed more than 2,800 people and infected 82,000.\\xa0     NEW SOUTH WALES: 5      January 25\\xa0     January 27 \\xa0     VICTORIA: 7      January 25     January 29     \\xa0January 30     February 1      \\xa0February 22\\xa0       QUEENSLAND: 9      January 29     January 30     February 4     February 5\\xa0\\xa0     February 6     February 21\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0      SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3      February 1        WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1         February 21         DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP: 8      \", \" A\\n Gold Coast beautician who was diagnosed with coronavirus after she \\nreturned from Iran could have infected up to 40 people in Australia.

A\\n 79-year-old west Australian woman has also tested positive after being \\nevacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan taking the \\noverall number of infected Australians to 25.   According to the Australian health department there are 84,117 cases world wide and 2,872 reported deaths.   'The\\n continuing increase in the number of cases and number of affected \\ncountries over the last few days are clearly of concern,' WHO chief \\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesushe said in Geneva.   He said that 24 \\nCovid-19 cases have now been exported from Italy - the worst-hit country\\n in Europe - to 14 countries and that 97 cases have been exported from \\nIran to 11 countries.   The UN health agency had previously labelled the global risk as 'high' but still short of calling it a pandemic.\\xa0   Health\\n minister Steven Miles reassured Queenslanders the Covid-19 virus \\nremained contained across the state, despite the latest development   The Australian government is already putting in place plans to tackle a pandemic.   In particular, it is looking at how aged care facilities could be locked down in the case of a coronavirus outbreak.   Prime\\n Minister Scott Morrison says while some countries such as Japan are \\nlooking at closing schools, there is no need to do that in Australia \\nbased on current medical advice.   However, the virus known as COVID-19 affects the elderly more.   'The\\n bigger impact would be in things like aged care facilities, the ability\\n to lock those down, and to have the right care and support to those who\\n are working in those places,' Mr Morrison said on Friday.\\xa0    Travellers at Brisbane International Airport on January 29 (pictured)    Health\\n ministers who met in Melbourne on Friday agreed the Commonwealth would \\ntake the lead on an aged care advanced planning process.   'Those \\nwho are elderly or those who have difficulties with their immune system \\nare most at risk and that is why they are absolute top priority,' \\nfederal Health Minister Greg Hunt said.   Aged care providers \\nreceived a letter this week from Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy \\noutlining the need for them to have emergency plans in place.   'While\\n the number of cases of COVID-19 is currently small in Australia, it is \\npossible that this situation could change and services need to plan and \\nbe prepared for this,' he wrote.   Federal opposition frontbencher \\nJason Clare said the government is doing the right thing even though the\\n WHO has yet to declare a pandemic.   'They have followed the advice\\n of the chief medical officer ... they have followed the advice of the \\nexperts,' Mr Clare told ABC television on Saturday.

Did we ever think we would see a day when supermarkets would impose \\nbuying restrictions on toilet paper? It seems ridiculous, right? But the\\n past few days have seen nervous customers panic-buying essential items \\nsuch as toilet paper, canned goods and rice, leaving supermarket shelves\\n bare. Some stores have even sold out of pet food and kitty litter.   As two behavioural scientists, wead both heard about toilet paper \\nbeing sold out but largely dismissed it as a passing anomaly. But upon \\nvisiting a local supermarket, sure enough, the shelves were empty.   Neither of us had intended to get caught up in the hype but then \\nasked each other ... if there was a packet left or if we happened to be \\nthere when they were restocking the shelves, would we have bought \\nadditional toilet paper? Of course we would. Why? Despite studying \\nbehaviour for years, our own reaction came as a surprise, especially \\nsince we both still had at least a weekas worth in our respective \\nhouses.   But, with further thought, the behaviour is largely explainable (behavioural scientists are very good at explaining behaviour  after  the fact!):   Itas seen as an essential product, without ready substitutes. In many\\n ways, toilet paper is similar to essential services. Imagine that the \\nwater utility told you they were cutting off the water in your \\nneighbourhood for an undetermined period. Iam sure theread be a surge in\\n water tank sales and that baths, sinks and buckets would be filled.   Toilet paper is easily stockpiled and doesnat deteriorate. Itas \\nrelatively a low cost/low risk investment and even if you have \\nstockpiled, itas something you will eventually use. Given weare aware of\\n people in quarantine for two weeks or longer, it makes sense to \\nstockpile non-perishables in case this happens in Australia.   In light of the first two reasons, buying toilet paper is an action \\nthat people can take now. The media (especially social media) may have \\nmade people feel helpless about the imminent arrival of Covid-19.   The virus has all the characteristics that make it scary a itas \\nnovel, invisible, we have no control, we are involuntarily exposed to \\nthe risk, it makes us feel dread and we are personally vulnerable. As \\nbox ticking goes, this one is right up there.   While there is some guidance on what individuals can do about it \\n(thorough hand washing and avoiding people), the media reminds us \\ncontinually of the relentless path. Buying toilet paper  alleviates some of this anxiety and helps us regain control.    Social media amplifies the fear which, in some way, seems to travel \\nfaster than the virus. The hashtags #toiletpapercrisis and \\n#toiletpapergate were trending on Twitter. Seeing image after image of \\nempty shelves sends signals to the public that this is an important \\nissue everyone is talking about. Whatas key to understand here is that \\nmedia typically serves as a surveillance function, alerting us to risks \\nthat we need to shield ourselves from.    The supermarket shelf itself also sends signals. Toilet paper is \\nbulky and, as itas removed, the shelves look empty quickly, which \\ntriggers the perceptions of scarcity. In reality, the situation appears \\nworse than it actually is.   We psychologically respond to scarcity. We hate missing out so when \\nthings are rare, particularly things we need, we chase them. Emotions \\ncan play a powerful role here. Weave all been in a situation where weave\\n missed out on something we thought we should buy, and felt remorse. In \\nbehavioural sciences, this is known as anticipated regret and, if you \\ncan get people to feel it, itas a powerful motivator. By making the \\npurchase, in some small way we protect ourselves from this feeling of \\nregret.   Humans are finely attuned to monitoring what everybody else is doing \\n(even subconsciously). Most of us use awhat other people doa as a mental\\n shortcut to decide on what the appropriate behaviour would be if we are\\n unsure. Itas a simple decision mechanism called asocial proof \\nheuristica, a concept popularised by psychologist Robert Cialdini. For \\ninstance, we litter more when the surrounding environment is littered, \\nbecause it signals to us that littering is the norm. Hotel guests are \\nalso more likely to reuse their towels if told that athe majority of \\nguests reuse their towelsa. So, when we see people stockpiling toilet \\npaper, the natural reaction is to do the same. Social proof can help \\ndecide how to act, or reassure us that we are taking the right action.   We use this same principle of social proof when judging risk. Think \\nof a situation where you hear an alarm go off. Most of us will instantly\\n look around to see what others are doing, and to decide whether this is\\n something to be taken seriously. If everyone reacts then we will tend \\nto do the same.   Experts and governments have been telling us about pandemic \\npreparedness, weave been urged to prepare as the widespread message has \\nbeen that health systems across the world will struggle to cope. \\nEverything gives the signal to prepare. So is anyone surprised when we \\nsee people panic-buying essentials?   There are at least three factors driving our response a scarcity, \\nsocial proof, and regaining a sense of control. Itas scary how strong \\nthese influences are on our behaviour. Stockpiling is not needed, yet we\\n still have the urge to do it. As behavioural researchers, we intimately\\n know the forces acting on us, yet weare helpless to resist them.    aC/  Professor Liam Smith is the director of BehaviourWorks Australia, Monash Sustainable Development Institute    aC/  Dr Celine Klemm is a research fellow at BehaviourWorks Australia   ', ' The demise of AAP has unexpectedly ignited a war of words between media companies over who is to blame.   According to News Corp a one of the major shareholders who actually \\ntook the decision to close AAP a the shuttering of the vital news \\nservice is the fault of digital giants Google and  Facebook  a| and the ABC and Guardian Australia. Wait. What?   In the fallout over AAP in the last few days, News Corp has used its \\nsignificant real estate to attack both media organisations, with \\narticles appearing in the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and  other Murdoch titles  shifting blame to competitors.   A page three story in the Australian on Friday accused Guardian \\nAustralia of agobsmacking hypocrisya for reporting that, along with the \\nvery compelling financial reasons for closing the service, News Corp and\\n Nine told staff they  no longer wanted to subsidise  a breaking news service for their competitors. Neither News nor Nine have denied making the comments.   The AAP chairman, Campbell Reid, fired off a statement after the \\nGuardian report saying it was aone of the very companies that slashed \\nthe amount it was prepared to pay for AAPa.   A senior executive for News Corp, Reid is also furious with the media\\n union, the MEAA, for questioning News Corpas motives for suddenly \\nclosing the wire service and throwing 600 people into unemployment.   Guardian hypocrisy over AAP shutdown  https://t.co/bonD9uUIdh    a[The Guardian] is one of the organisations whose decisions have \\ncontributed to the closure of AAP and it and the [Media Entertainment \\nand Arts Allianceas] leadership should confront the bigger, tectonic \\nforces our entire industry faces rather than trot out this arrant \\nnonsense,a  Reid thundered.    Guardian Australiaas editor, Lenore Taylor, who was not given a right of reply by the Oz,  says: \\n aWe were offered a discount by AAP when we renegotiated last year \\nbecause we were using fewer services as we expanded our own reporting \\nteams.a   aMr Reidas statement is based on false premises,a Taylor said on \\nTwitter. aNo one at Guardian Australia has ever suggested the decision \\nto close AAP was made primarily to hurt small media organisations. We \\nhave written that it was a commercial decision.

An \\neditorial in the Daily Telegraph argued that Auntyas free content was \\ncutting their lunch.   aAdditionally, AAP found itself competing with an ever-expanding ABC,\\n which in defiance of the public good and media viability now dominates a\\n great deal of the online realm through tax-funded content,a editor Ben \\nEnglish editorialised.   aThe forthcoming loss of AAP will be a crushing blow to media \\ndiversity, brought about by behemoth organisations that care little for a\\n plurality of sources.a   We know that News Corp is responsible for much of the climate denial published in the Australian media a  no matter what Rupert Murdoch claimed  a but now we have some hard data to put it in context.   First the good news. Reporting on bushfires is now far more likely to\\n mention climate change, a study by Monash University has found.   The  report from the Monash Climate Change \\n Communication Research Hub, found that 49% of the media coverage of the\\n recent bushfires mentioned climate change, compared with 5% of reports \\nabout Black Saturday in 2009.   The researchers analysed 1% of articles between 1 September and 31 \\nJanuary and found only 5% of overall coverage featured climate \\ndenialism, down from 21% in 2009.   But it was News Corp publications that represented 59% of all the \\ndenialist discussion of climate change. The former Fairfax papers, now \\nowned by Nine Entertainment, made up 19% of denialism.   The coverage of protests by school children and Extinction Rebellion \\nshowed that, of the 2% of articles that criticised the actions of the \\nprotesters, a whopping 84% appeared in News Corp.   The ABC wants the government to reverse its decision to impose an \\n$84m indexation pause, an unlikely outcome with the details of cuts to \\nstaff and services due to be unveiled this month and no sign of the \\ngovernment softening.   But before the ABC managing director, David Anderson, could make a \\nfinal plea to parliamentarians on Tuesday, the delicate \\nbehind-the-scenes negotiations between the communications minister and \\nthe ABC were leaked to the papers a twice.   A letter written by the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, to Anderson appeared in the  pages of the Sydney Morning Herald . Fletcher had astrongly urgeda the ABC to consider selling its capital city offices to cope with the $84m budget cut.   Anderson addressed the suggestion in Senate estimates later that day,\\n saying the property portfolio had been examined many times and the idea\\n was not new.   He also told senators the summer bushfires added an extra $3m in \\nemergency broadcasting costs to the ABC budget at a time when the \\ncorporation had to absorb an ongoing annual budget cut of $105.9m.   That $105.9m figure represents all the cuts the Coalition has made to\\n Aunty between 2014, when Tony Abbott promised no cuts to the ABC or \\nSBS, and 2022, when the indexation pause ends.   The next day the Australian had another leaked letter, this time from\\n Anderson to Fletcher. Anderson said if the government reversed the cuts\\n the corporation would find $10m to fund additional regional services.   Alas, weare digesting our own aindexation pausea \\nbudget cuts .. $84 million over three years, more jobs in the industry \\nwill be lost.  https://t.co/S1qHcGF6by    aIf indexation was restored, combined with savings and efficiencies \\nthat the ABC has identified in recent months, the corporation would be \\nin a position to commit an additional investment of up to $10m per annum\\n to employ more journos in regional Australia and generate more content \\nfrom regions for local and international stories,a the MD wrote.   With the defence minister, Linda Reynolds, angrily insisting it was \\nan aindexation pausea and ABC executives saying it was a cut, we canat \\nsee the negotiations being successful.   The ABCas editorial director, Craig McMurtrie, was grilled at \\nestimates about whether there had been any political interference in ABC\\n News in relation to a report about sports rorts and another about a \\nRural Fire Service volunteer, Paul Parker, who told the prime minister \\nto aget fucked from Nelligena in a viral news clip.   ABCas Media Watch revealed last month that a news story about Parker \\nwas filed for the ABCas 7pm bulletin but didnat run. Then the story was \\nslated to run on News Breakfast, only that didnat run either.

At \\nthe next opportunity the story wasnat run because the anews cycle had \\nmoveda, he said   aThe important thing was that the newsroom had made the call and there was no pressure or intervention,a McMurtrie said.   What did emerge from the exchange was that Anderson has never had a \\ncall from Scott Morrison personally a but he has received emailed \\ncomplaints from the PMas office.   Anderson said the PMO emailed him about a story on the Lilli Pilli \\nsports club, and after the story was examined it was amended and a \\ncorrection published because it was based on a false assumption in a \\nFacebook post. The story didnat meet ABC editorial standards, McMurtrie \\nsaid, and it had nothing to do with political influence.   aOn 20 January, ABC News Online published a story that suggested the \\nLilli Pilli Soccer Club may have had prior knowledge of a Sport \\nAustralia grant for the second stage of the expansion of its clubhouse,a\\n the ABC correction says.

However, women in music are still disadvantaged in terms of \\nincome, inclusion and professional opportunities. In Australia a \\nnational approach to improving gender equity in music has begun to \\nemerge as once-controversial strategies trialled by four tertiary \\ninstitutions have become established practices. This article discusses \\nsuccessful inclusion strategies for women in music, including the \\ncommitment to gender-balanced programming across all concerts at \\nQueensland Conservatorium of Music by 2025, the introduction of \\nmandatory quotas in recital programmes at Monash University, mentoring \\nprogrammes for women composers at Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and \\nthe development of coursework devoted to women in music at The \\nUniversity of Western Australia, as well as other initiatives that have \\nemerged from them, both within and beyond the institution.

The public willingness to engage in discussions over \\nsexual harassment, sexual assault and gender discrimination in the \\nworkplace that has resulted from the #MeToo movement is cited as key in \\ninfluencing the engagement of students and professionals with these \\nstrategies and subsequent influence on performance practices, project \\ndevelopment and presentational formats in new music.

He\\n said: aThe global population is susceptible given this is a new virus \\nintroduced into human circulation and capable of human to human \\ntransmission.   aWhile most people will only get mild symptoms (or \\neven no symptoms), there will be a small fraction of individuals who \\nwill react severely.   aThis equates to a large number of people if the majority of the population is susceptible.a    DON'T MISS    He\\n added: aGiven the rapid spread, an uncontrolled outbreak can easily \\noverwhelm health services (there are only a certain number of beds in \\nICUs to help people with severe respiratory disease).   aSlowing the\\n spread therefore might not stop people getting infected but it will \\nhelp authorities cope with those with severe infection.a   To help slow down the spread of coronavirus, health officials are urging people to practice good hygiene.

Here \\nshe answers some questions about issues arising from the murders in \\nBrisbane of Hannah Clarke and her three children Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4 \\nand Trey, 3.    Hannah Clarkeas family described her husband Rowan Baxter as \\ncontrolling, coercive and obsessive. His abuse appears to have followed a\\n familiar script known as coercive control. Can you explain this?    Coercive control is a very particular kind of domestic abuse. Itas \\nnot a areactiona to stress, nor is it triggered by alcohol or drugs. \\nItas an ongoing system of control, in which the abusive partner seeks to\\n override their partneras autonomy and destroy their sense of self. The \\nend game a whether the perpetrator knowingly sets out to achieve it a is\\n to make their partner entirely subordinate; a awilling slavea. To do \\nthis, they isolate, micro-manage, humiliate, degrade, surveil, gaslight \\nand create an environment of confusion, contradiction and extreme \\nthreat. The feeling victims have, as the British survivor-advocate Min \\nGrob tweeted the other day, is that the rug has been pulled from under \\nyour feet. aYou become disoriented, hyper vigilant, confused and most \\nlikely sleep-deprived. You are walking on eggshells. Afraid youare going\\n mad. Afraid to make them mad. Afraid. All the time. Sometimes not even \\nknowing why youare in fear but the panic is there. Always.a This abuse \\ncan also be incredibly hard for the victim to detect, because it happens\\n slowly, bit by bit. Itas the total mental dislocation of coercive \\ncontrol a which Amnesty International has classified as torture a that \\nis the hardest thing to recover from.   Coercive controllers may use extreme physical or sexual violence; or,\\n as was reportedly the case with Rowan Baxter, no physical violence at \\nall. For more than 40 years, women and children have been saying that \\nexcept for extreme violence, the coercive control is the worst part. In \\nfact, one of the most common refrains from victims of coercive control \\nis aI wish head just hit mea.    If domestic abuse cases almost always follow the same script, as you write in your book, why is it so hard to stop them?    So many reasons, but in cases of coercive control, I think it boils \\ndown to this. Many women donat know they are experiencing abuse until \\nthey are already in situations that are incredibly dangerous a partly \\nbecause coercive control is so poorly understood, but also because the \\nperpetrator makes it invisible. By the time victims realise the danger \\ntheyare in, many believe no system will ever be powerful enough to keep \\nthem safe. If they do report to police a if something reportable \\nactually occurs a they are making a terrifying gamble. Will they get an \\nofficer whoas sympathetic and proactive? Will reporting their partner \\nmake him more dangerous? What if child protection gets involved? What if\\n he contests for custody? There are absolutely no guarantees that they \\n(or their children) will be protected. Their suspicion that the system \\nis not powerful enough to protect them is too often correct. The justice\\n system is not only full of holes; too often it actively colludes with \\nthe perpetrator (especially the family law system). So they stay, even \\nafter they want to leave, and know itas dangerous. They stay because it \\nmay be even more dangerous to leave. Until the justice system properly \\nassesses  and responds  to risk, and as long as women are made to\\n be responsible for their own safety, we will continue to see an \\nintractable domestic homicide rate.    How do some men come to feel so entitled to their power over women?    Thousands of years of patriarchy has laid pretty good groundwork for \\nthis a and itas not so long since a wife was considered her husbandas \\nproperty, and had no legal rights whatsoever. It was only in the 1980s \\nthat new laws against marital rape recognised that men didnat have the \\nright to demand sex with their wives anytime they wanted; prior to that,\\n consent was considered to have been given on the wedding day and never \\nrevoked. Today, we still live in a society that entrenches womenas \\nsubordination at every level a from the home, to the boardroom, to our \\nparliament. Even in the courtroom, as we see so often. As the Harvard \\npsychiatrist Judith Herman writes: aThe legal system is designed to \\nprotect men from the superior power of the state but not to protect \\nwomen or children from the superior power of men.a Iam sure any survivor\\n reading this will know exactly what sheas talking about.   Men donat abuse women because society tells them itas OK. Men abuse \\nwomen because society tells them they are entitled to be in control. In \\nfact, society says that if they are  not  in control, they wonat \\nsucceed a they wonat get the girl, they wonat get the money, and they \\nwill be vulnerable to the violence and control of other men. It says \\nthat if they fail to assert themselves like areal mena, they will end up\\n poor and alone.   But we donat just see men being entitled to power over their \\npartners; some women identify with this, too. Thatas because ahaving \\npower overa is valued within patriarchy a much more for men than it is \\nfor women a but nevertheless, it is regarded generally as a sign of \\nstrength to claim power over others. To add more complication, in many \\nperpetrators who have had trauma or attachment disruption in their \\nchildhoods, you get another layer of entitlement: as one perpetrator \\ntold me aI never had any control over anything as a child, and I vowed \\nthat I would never let that happen to me again. I would always be in \\ncontrol.a   Trauma-based entitlement is very common in people who are abusive a \\nthe notion that aI had to go through so much, so fuck you, you just have\\n to deal with whatever I do to you.a When that entitlement is thwarted, \\nthere is this notion of being defied, of being humiliated a of being \\nshamed. This is what has been called ahumiliated furya a when \\ninsecurity, toxic shame and entitlement combine. That is a very \\ndangerous emotional state.    Do behaviour change programs for men work?    Opinions a and studies - on this are mixed. Here in Australia, group \\ntherapeutic programs generally run for a few months, once a week. A  recent study \\n by Monash University found that 65% of men report that they are \\naviolence freea or almost violence free two years after the program \\nended; that is a very encouraging result. There are a couple of \\nresidential therapeutic programs, like Breathing Space in Western \\nAustralia and Room4Change in Canberra, that I think are also really \\npromising a they give men a place to live, so women and children donat \\nhave to leave, and they follow up intensive individual and group work \\nwith months of ongoing outreach support. Indigenous menas programs \\nthroughout the country are also some of the best Iave seen, in terms of \\nreconnecting men to what is meaningful.   But the model I keep coming back to is one that actually takes \\nseriously the deep work that is required to shift men out of \\nlong-habituated behaviour. Itas a Scottish program called the Caledonian\\n model, and it runs for two years. It combines two approaches to \\noffending that are typically at odds with each other a the \\npsychopathology model, which looks at what drives a specific person to \\nabuse, and the feminist model, which looks at how men are socialised \\nunder patriarchy, and how gender inequality underpins their abusive \\nbehaviour.   To do this it gives abusers six months of one-on-one counselling to \\nbegin with, and puts them in touch with specialists who can deal with \\nany other presenting issues: addiction, mental illness, childhood \\ntrauma, etc. After that they go into a group program with other men, \\nwhere they confront issues around gendered expectations, socialisation, \\nwhat actually constitutes abuse and so on. Then they go back into \\none-on-one counselling. Throughout that time, caseworkers are also \\nworking directly with their partners or ex-partners, and their children.\\n Itas a fantastic model.    How can you help a friend if you think they are being coercively controlled?    When you first hear those red flags a isolation, micro-management, \\nrule-setting, financial control a you need to respond carefully. Listen \\nwithout judgement. Criticise their partneras behaviour, but donat \\ncondemn their partner a that may only make them defensive. Comment on \\nthe changes youave notice in them personally, and why youare worried \\nabout it. Most importantly, donat give up. The perpetrator wants their \\npartner to be isolated a donat enable them. Stay in contact, if you can.\\n Remember always that your friend is the expert in their own experience,\\n and they donat need you to take over. Let them know that if they are \\nthinking of leaving, they should get in touch with a domestic violence \\ncaseworker, so they can develop a safety plan. Lastly, donat make your \\nfriendship conditional on your friend leaving a they may take months or \\nyears to leave, or they may never leave. Just let them know you will be \\nthere for them, no matter what.    The federal government says it is open to new ideas for reducing violence. Can you suggest any?    We need practical action, at the coalface, that encourages a and \\nsupports a women to seek help, keeps them and their children safe, and \\nremoves the loopholes of impunity for perpetrators.   If the government wants new ideas, here are some bold new strategies a\\n proven to reduce domestic abuse here and internationally a that we \\nshould be seriously considering.   First, the introduction of police stations for women, which are \\nsolely dedicated to policing family violence (and provide a one-stop \\nshop for women and children, including therapeutic, legal and financial \\nhelp), have been proven to reduce domestic homicide in countries across \\nSouth America, and crucially, they get women reporting earlier. Greens \\nco-deputy Larissa Waters is calling for a trial of these womenas police \\nstations.   Second we should look very seriously at criminalising coercive \\ncontrol, as has been promised by the Queensland opposition leader, Deb \\nFrecklington, and urged by New South Wales MP Anna Watson. Criminalising\\n coercive control is not just about locking people up. Itas about  changing the paradigm on domestic abuse \\n and requiring police to investigate and report on the entire arc of a \\nrelationship, instead of isolated incidents. Globally speaking, Scotland\\n is seen as the world leader, as all of the harms of domestic abuse are \\nincluded under the one charge.    Third, Iam also a big advocate of localised strategies, like focused \\ndeterrence and justice reinvestment, that develop close and constant \\ncollaboration between the community sector a domestic abuse, substance \\nabuse, homelessness and so on a and the justice system. These strategies\\n break down silos between sector groups that often work at odds with \\neach other, they close loopholes in the justice system, and they deliver\\n a strong message to perpetrators that unless they accept the help that \\nis on offer, and make the rational choice to stop their offending, they \\nwill feel the full force of the law.   Last, fix the family law system. The Australian Law Reform Commission\\n has delivered a set of reforms that will make children safe. Implement \\nthem.    What could we do today - right now - to urgently improve this situation and prevent more murders like this?    The good news is we know that change is possible.   Here are some critical changes the federal parliament could introduce\\n now. To begin with, straightaway announce enough secure funding for the\\n womenas refuge sector to ensure no woman or child is denied vital \\nprotection. Allocate proper funding for affordable and transitional \\nhousing so they can move into homes they can afford. Reverse funding \\ncuts to community legal aid a we just saw $130,000 in funding removed \\nfrom Victoria Legal Aid, which has cancelled the Court Network of \\nvolunteers who help family violence victims at the family law courts; \\ncommunity legal aid is already woefully underfunded. There is so much \\ngood work already being done a if the federal government truly cared \\nabout women and childrenas safety, theyad stop making the womenas sector\\n beg and scrape for basic funding.

', ' In 2014, Joe Duggan started reaching out to climate scientists to ask them a question: how did climate change make them feel?   aI was just blown away when I started getting the letters back,a he says.   Duggan, a science communicator at Australian National University, set\\n up a website and starting publishing the mostly handwritten responses.   a[Professor] Katrin Meissner was one of the first, and her letter really hit me. It was so ... unscience-y. Almost poetic.a   aIt makes me feel sad. And it scares me,a Meissner wrote.   aIt scares me more than anything else. I see a group of people \\nsitting in a boat, happily waving, taking pictures on the way, not \\nknowing that this boat is floating right into a powerful and deadly \\nwaterfall.a   In the end, more than 40 scientists responded a many leaders in their\\n field. Some wrote neatly on lined notepaper, others scrawled on the \\nback of student papers they were marking.   aIt became a big part of my life,a Duggan says. aI felt a little bit \\nout of my depth. It took its toll on me and in the end I felt I had to \\nstep away. I went into my shell and pretty much turned off my phone for \\nthree years.   aBut Iave got some emotional resilience back now. My partner and I \\nfound out weare pregnant a due in August. I donat want that kid to grow \\nup asking why we didnat actually do anything.a   So Duggan has returned to his apassion projecta a  Is This How You Feel  a by asking the scientists to write again. Have their feelings changed in the intervening years?   The first 10 return letters are emotional outpourings of despair, \\nhope, fear and determination in the age of the climate crisis, from the \\npeople helping the world understand its impacts while also being mums, \\ndads and grandparents.   Since the first letters were written, two Australian correspondents  Tony McMichael  and  Michael Raupach  have died. But Duggan is trying to reach their family members to see if they can keep the legacy moving.   Meissner, now director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the \\nUniversity of New South Wales, didnat hesitate to respond partly because\\n ait was the right thing to doa.   aBut also because we have not been very good at communicating climate\\n science to the public and I believe that it is my duty as a citizen to \\nalert people to the urgency of the situation.a   But does Meissner think thereas a risk in scientists lifting their \\nveil of cool objectivity to show their personal feelings? Could it cause\\n some to question their objectivity?   aI actually think that the opposite is the case,a she says. aWhen I \\nsaw the whole collection of letters a few years ago, I was surprised by \\nthe number of colleagues who had participated.   aWe are talking here about world-leading scientists, people who built\\n their career on facts and data, who are spending their lives \\nquestioning every result they find, over and over again. People who are \\ncontinuously challenging the status quo. People who are trained to be \\nobjective.   aWhen these people start to speak up about their feelings, about \\nbeing frustrated, desperate, worried, angry or scared, then we really \\nshould listen very carefully.a   Duggan wants anyone who has read the letters to write their own, and \\nshare them. Here are some excerpts from the latest scientist letters \\nfrom Dugganas project.   How do I feel about it? I am still very worried. I am also profoundly sad. I am probably sadder than I was five years ago.   I feel powerless and, to a certain extent, guilty. I feel like I\\n have failed my duty as a citizen and as a mother because I was not able\\n to communicate the urgency of the situation well enough to trigger \\nmeaningful action in time.   What we are doing right now is an uncontrolled, risky experiment with the planet we live on.   Iam angry because the lack of effective action on climate change, \\ndespite the wealth not only of scientific information but also of \\nsolutions to reduce emissions, has now created a climate emergency.   The students are right. Their future is now being threatening by the \\ngreed of the wealthy fossil fuel elite, the lies of the Murdoch press, \\nand the weakness of our political leaders. These people have no right to\\n destroy my daughteras future and that of her generation.   My emotions havenat really changed since I last wrote one of these \\nletters, but things around me have. The beacon of light that is Greta \\nThunberg, speaking truth to power. Our own wonderful, passionate school \\nkids taking to the streets, making me cry with pride.  The only way \\nto cope with all of this is to focus on what I can do, what Iam best at,\\n and hope like hell that enough people, doing what they do best, can \\novercome.   I have some very dark moments, but more than ever before, I feel \\nwrapped in a blanket of collective determination. Hope is a necessary \\nemotion, but more than that, it must be our fundamental strategy to keep\\n us going. Lose it, and we are lost.   For the most part my comments of 19 September 2014 still apply except\\n that the glimmer of hope has diminished if not vanished entirely. With \\nObama as US president and the Paris agreement in late 2015, a glimmer of\\n hope seemed to emerge, but with Trump and his ignorant accomplices, the\\n hope has vanished.   I am close to retirement and as I was cleaning up in 2019 I found \\nsome old VHS tapes recording me on shows, such as the Lehrer News Hour \\non PBS in 1988, and the message then was much the same as now except we \\nare now more confident and the progress has been nil. It was depressing.\\n My solution has been to move back to New Zealand along with my daughter\\n and family (grandchildren).   Realistically, we are already too late to meet a 1.5 degree target and will struggle to achieve 2 degrees.   So, the future, basically, looks bad. Hard to stay hopeful. Change is too slow, too late.   Yet we have to stay optimistic.   Dear Joe, a Climate Change feels very real and I think this \\nsummer we reached a tipping point in Australia. As I write this my \\nhusband, a bushfire fighter, is battling a fire in Canberra and Iam \\nworking from home as a freak hailstorm destroyed my car three days ago. \\nIn four days, weave been smashed by our climate: hail, extreme winds, \\ntoxic smoke and fire.   a|. So how do I feel? Frustrated, angry that our science is ignored by\\n politicians, scared for my husband and all the others who are on the \\nfrontline fighting these fires and trying to help.   But mostly I feel devastated for my son, and his generation, who will\\n have to heal this planet and live with the mass environmental \\ndestruction we have caused.   I feel scared for the future when faced with simple downright ignorance from some political leaders.   I\\n feel tired, tired that in spite of bushfires, floods etc I still seem \\nto be banging my head against a brick wall to convince people that the \\nthreat of climate change is severe.   I feel relieved that now I am retired I donat have to live and breathe this every minute of every day.   I feel guilty that I am stepping back from the frontline, so even though I am retired I feel compelled to carry on working.   I\\n feel unspeakable joy at the news that I am to become a grandfather for \\nthe first time, but fearful of the world my grandchild will grow up in.   I feel relieved that when my grandchild grows up and asks me why\\n we did nothing to stop climate change I can at least say that I did my \\nbest.   As I sit writing this on a bench looking out over the moors I\\n feel uplifted that despite everything the world is still the most \\nbeautiful place.

With 289 consecutive days in space, \\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronaut made \\nhistory on Dec. 28, 2019, by surpassing Peggy Whitsonas record for the \\nlongest spaceflight in a single mission by a woman. By the time Koch \\nreturned to Earth in February 2020, she had spent 328 days in space a \\nthe second highest in a single mission by an American astronaut. With \\nfellow astronaut Jessica Meir, Koch set another milestone during the \\nmission a the first all-female spacewalk (pictured, R).   At the Stuttgart World Championships \\nheld in October 2019, Biles became the first gymnast to win five gold \\nmedals at a single world championship since 1958. The medal haul, which \\nbrought her world medal total to 25, also helped her break Belarusian \\nVitaly Scherboas career total of 23 to become the worldas most decorated\\n gymnast.   Thomas, an American football \\nofficial, made history as the first female referee to officiate a \\nNational Football League (NFL) playoff game on Jan. 13, 2019 (pictured).\\n Before the remarkable first, Thomas had already created history as the \\nfirst woman to referee a major college football game in 2007. Two years \\nlater, she became the first woman to officiate in a bowl game and in \\n2011 was the first woman to officiate in a Big Ten stadium as a line \\njudge. In 2015, she was hired as the first full-time female referee in \\nNFL history.   An ethnic Yazidi from Iraq, Murad \\nshared the Nobel Prize for Peace with Congolese gynecologist Denis \\nMukwege in 2018 for their \"efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a\\n weapon of war and armed conflict.\" She was kept as a captive by the \\nIslamic State (ISIS) who attacked her village when she was 19. In 2015, \\nMurad managed to take refuge in Germany, where she works as an activist \\nhelping women and children who are victims of abuse and human \\ntrafficking.   The civil rights activist founded the\\n \"Me Too\" movement in 2006 to raise awareness about sexual abuse and to \\nbuild solidarity among survivors of sexual harassment. The use of #MeToo\\n as a hashtag became a global phenomenon in 2017 in the wake of \\nallegations of sexual abuse against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.\\n Today, the hashtag is used across the world to highlight cases of \\nsexual harassment or assault. In 2017, Time magazine included Burke \\namong \"The Silence Breakers,\" a group of women it named as its 2017 \\nPerson of the Year.   On April 24, 2017, Whitson, the first\\n woman to have commanded the International Space Station (ISS) twice, \\nbroke the record for the most cumulative days spent in space by any NASA\\n astronaut by clocking more than 534 days. By September that year, she \\naccumulated a total of 665 days over the course of her career a the most\\n by any woman worldwide. Whitson also set other records a the oldest \\nfemale astronaut at age 57 and woman astronaut with most spacewalks \\n(10). She retired from NASA on June 15, 2018.   She made history as the first female \\ncoach to lead a menas soccer team (Eastern Sports Club) to a \\nprofessional top-flight league championship victory in May 2016. For the\\n feat, Chan, who was 27 years old at the time, was named among the top \\nwomen of the year by the BBC and received the Asian Football \\nConfederation (AFC) Womenas Coach of the Year award. Her achievement was\\n also recognized by Guinness World Records.   Payne became the first-ever female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup in the horse raceas 155 years of history on Nov. 3, 2015.   One of the leading figures of the \\nFrench New Wave film movement, Varda (1928-2019) became the first woman \\nto receive an honorary Palme d\\'or in May 2015. The prize is given to \\ndirectors whose works have had a global impact. Varda\\'s work on social \\nissues and feminist topics, and her unconventional methods in film \\ndirection brought about a fresh trend in the world of arts.   In 2014, Yousafzai became the \\nyoungest Nobel laureate at the age of 17 when she was jointly awarded \\nthe Nobel Peace prize with Indiaas Kailash Satyarthi afor their struggle\\n against the suppression of children and young people and for the right \\nof all children to education.\" The Pakistani activist grabbed the \\nworldas attention when she was shot in the head in 2012 by the Taliban \\nfor advocating girlas education in her native Swat Valley. Yousafzai is \\ntoday counted among the most powerful voices for the rights of children.   Diacre became the first woman to lead\\n a men\\'s professional soccer team (Clermont Foot 63) in a major European\\n country (France) on Aug. 4, 2014. Three years later, she was appointed \\nas the manager of Franceas womenas national team a a position she \\ncurrently holds.   One of the most accomplished women in\\n auto racing, Patrick created history when she became the first woman to\\n clinch pole position for the Daytona 500 a NASCAR\\'s highest division a \\non Feb. 17, 2013. In the subsequent race, she finished eighth a the \\nbest-ever finish by a woman at the event. In 2015, Patrick beat Janet \\nGuthrie\\'s record for the most top-ten finishes (six) by a woman in the \\nSprint Cup Series. She retired from the sport in 2018.   In 2013, McFadden became the first \\nfemale athlete to win six gold medals at the 2013 IPC Athletics World \\nChampionships in Lyon, France. She claimed gold in every category: from \\nthe 100m meters through to the 5,000 meters events. Winning the Boston, \\nChicago, London and New York marathons in 2013, she became the first \\nperson to win all four World Major Marathons in the same year.

She was 64 at the \\ntime.   In May 2012, Napravnik became the \\nfirst woman jockey to win the U.S. Kentucky Oaks. She won the same race \\nagain in 2014. She also won the Breedersa Cup twice a in 2012 and 2014. \\nNapravnik was seven weeks pregnant when she won the championship the \\nsecond time.   Bigelow created history by becoming \\nthe first woman to bag an Oscar for Best Director in 2010 for the movie \\naThe Hurt Lockera (2009). She was also the first woman to be awarded by \\nthe Directors Guild of America in its 62-year history for the same \\nmovie. Bigelow\\'s other hits include aStrange Daysa (1995), aK-19: The \\nWidowmakera (2002) and aZero Dark Thirtya (2012).   On Feb. 1, 2009, she became the first\\n female prime minister of Iceland and the world\\'s first openly gay head \\nof government. Advocating gay-rights and gender equality, SigurAdegardA3ttir\\n set an example by marrying her partner on June 27, 2010 a the day \\nsame-sex marriages were legalized in her country.   On Sept. 18, 2006, the \\nIranian-American businesswoman became the first female space tourist \\nwhen a Soyuz space capsule took off with her and two astronauts for the \\nInternational Space Station from Kazakhstan\\'s Baikonur Cosmodrome. She \\nwas also the first self-funded woman to fly to space. Ansari talked \\nabout her experiences in her memoir aMy Dream of Stars: From Daughter of\\n Iran to Space Pioneer,a published in 2010. In 2018, she became the CEO \\nof XPRIZE, a nonprofit organization.   The first woman judge in Iran, Ebadi \\nwas honored with the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2003 afor her efforts for \\ndemocracy and human rights.a The Nobel citation also states that she \\nahas focused especially on the struggle for the rights of women and \\nchildren.\" Forced to work as a clerk in following the 1979 Islamic \\nRevolution, Ebadi took early retirement in protest. It was not until \\n1992 that she was able to obtain a lawyeras license and set up private \\npractice, which enabled her to represent and fight for the rights of \\nwomen and children.   Taymor received the Tony Award for \\nOutstanding Direction of a Musical for aThe Lion Kinga in 1998, making \\nher the first woman to win the honor. The second award she won for the \\nproduction was Outstanding Costume Design. Apart from helming Broadway \\nhits such as aThe Green Birda (2000) and aSpider-Man: Turn Off The Darka\\n (2011), Taymor directed acclaimed films such as aFridaa (2002) and \\naAcross the Universea (2007).   The U.S. astronaut became the first \\nwoman to pilot a space mission, serving as second-in-command for \\nDiscovery, in 1995. She was given the command of space shuttle Columbia \\nin 1999, making her the first female shuttle commander.   Franklin (1942-2018) was the first \\nwoman performer to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in \\n1987, when she was 45. A winner of 18 Grammy Awards, she was ranked \\nnumber one by Rolling Stone magazine on its 100 Greatest Singers of All \\nTime in 2010.   With her July 1984 mission, Soviet \\ncosmonaut Savitskaya became not only the first woman to have gone to \\nspace twice but also the first woman to perform a spacewalk (pictured, \\nR). During the mission, she spent three hours and 35 minutes outside the\\n Salyut 7 space station cutting and welding metals a a feat that made \\nher first person to weld in space.   On May 16, 1975, more than 20 years \\nafter the Mount Everest was first scaled, Tabei (1939-2016) became the \\nfirst woman mountaineer to reach the summit (pictured, R). The Japanese \\nmountaineer continued scaling peaks, and in June 1992 became the first \\nwoman to scale the Seven Summits, the highest mountains of each \\ncontinent.   The Welsh novelistas (1923-2004) \\nfourth book, aThe Elected Membera (1969) made her the first woman to win\\n the Man Booker Prize in 1970. Her other notable works include aBirds of\\n Passagea (1981) aKingdom Comea (1990), aA Solitary Griefa (1991) and \\naThe Waiting Gamea (1997). Some of Ruben\\'s books, such as aMadame \\nSousatzkaa (1962), have been adapted for films and TV series.   Geraldine \"Jerrie\" Mock (1925-2014) \\nbecame the first woman to fly solo around the world on April 17, 1964, \\ncovering a distance of 23,103 miles (37,180 kilometers) in 29 days 11 \\nhours and 59 minutes. For her accomplishment, the American was awarded \\nthe Louis BlA(c)riot silver medal from the FA(c)dA(c)ration AA(c)ronautique \\nInternationale a the first American and first woman to be so honored a \\nand Federal Aviation Administration\\'s Exception Service Decoration by \\nthe then-U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. She published her \\nstory in the book aThree-Eight Charlie,a released in 1970.   Tereshkova was selected from among a \\ngroup of four trained women to pilot the Vostok 6 in June 1963, making \\nher the first woman to have reached space. Following her successful \\nmission during which she orbited Earth 48 times in three days, \\nTereshkova started an active political life and represented the Soviet \\nUnion at international events.   Colonel Cochran (1906-80) of the U.S.\\n became the first woman to fly at supersonic speeds in 1953. She was \\nalso the first woman to fly a bomber across the Atlantic. At the time of\\n her death, she held the records for the maximum speed, distance and \\naltitude in the history of aviation.   Dinsdale (1926-99) was present at the\\n first Emmy presentation ceremony to receive the first ever award for \\nOutstanding Television Personality. The ventriloquist broke into radio \\nwith aJudy Splinters,a her dummy, which also got her a childrenas TV \\nshow after she won the award.   The renowned Danish actress \\n(1889-1964) debuted as a director with aAfsporeta in 1942 and made nine \\nmore films in the next nine years. She went on to win four Bodil awards,\\n which were named after her and fellow actress Bodil Kjer.   Earhart (1897-1939, pictured, R) was a\\n pioneer in the field of aviation and became the first woman to fly \\nacross the Atlantic Ocean as a passenger in 1928 and solo in 1932. She \\nwas instrumental in the formation of the Ninety-Nines, an international \\norganization for female pilots, of which she was the first president. \\nEarhart, along with Fred Noonan, disappeared over the Pacific Ocean \\nduring a circumnavigation attempt in 1937. She was officially declared \\ndead two years later.\\xa0   The American competition swimmer \\n(1905-2003) was the first woman to swim across the English Channel, a \\ntask she accomplished on Aug. 6, 1926. In her later years, Ederle, who \\nhad a hearing problem since childhood, became a swimming instructor for \\ndeaf children.   The Canadian-American explorer \\n(1906-96) is regarded as the first woman to drive around the world a a \\nfeat she started working on when she was 16 a as certified by the \\nGuinness World Records. Driving a Ford Model-T, she began from Nice, \\nFrance, in December 1922 and reached back in January 1927.   Marvingt (1875-1963; pictured, R) \\nbecame the first woman to fly combat missions when she decided to become\\n a bomber pilot for France during World War I. Awarded the Croix de \\nGuerre, she was also instrumental in the introduction of air ambulance \\nservices.   Quimby (1875-1912) managed to change \\nthe scenario for women in aviation and, in 1911, became the first \\nAmerican woman to get a pilotas license. The next year, she became the \\nfirst female pilot to fly solo across the English Channel. Quimby was \\nkilled in an air crash in 1912.   The French aviatrix (1882-1919) \\nbecame the worldas first woman to receive an airplane pilotas license in\\n 1910. Despite suffering severe injuries during an air show, she \\ncontinued with flying and won a cup for flying nonstop for four hours. \\nShe died in a plane crash in 1919.   Curie\\'s (1867-1934) discovery of \\nradium and polonium led to her becoming the first woman to win the Nobel\\n Prize (in Physics) in 1903. In 1911, she became the first person and \\nthe only woman to win the prize twice when she was awarded for \\nChemistry. Her work on radioactivity shaped much of the scientific \\ndevelopments in the 20th and 21st centuries.    38/38 SLIDES \\n    STOPPING THE VIOLENCE    Living standards in Asia\\n and the Pacific have improved dramatically in the past years, with the \\nregion contributing two thirds of global growth, according to a recent \\nreport by the United Nations. aYet many people a and women especially a \\nremain left behind, caught in a net of inequalities that prevent them \\nfrom reaping the benefits of this growth,a it said.   aProgress \\ntowards gender parity in education has not translated into equal rights \\nfor women to labour markets, while violence against women remains \\nwidespread across the region.a   A poll of global experts in 2018 named India as the worldas most \\ndangerous country for women due to the high risk of sexual violence and \\nbeing forced into slave labour. War-torn Afghanistan and Syria came \\nsecond and third in the Thomson Reuters Foundation study, followed by \\nSomalia and Saudi Arabia.   But achange is certainly afoota, \\naccording to Puja Kapai, an associate professor of law at the University\\n of Hong Kong, who wrote about the evolution of the #MeToo movement in \\nAsia in the  Asian Jurist  last year.   Around Asia, in \\ncountries such as China, South Korea, Japan and India, the #MeToo \\nmovement against the harassment of women was aclearly building on \\ndecades of feminist organisation and activism to challenge the \\nwidespread perpetration and tolerance of sexual violence as a privilege \\nof the elite, powerful and well-connecteda, the scholar wrote.   Student leader Thakur rarely leaves the house without taking various \\nprecautions. aWhen we go out we wonat wear certain things, we have \\npepper spray in our bag, we have emergency contacts in our phones, and \\nwe often share live locations with each other,a says Thakur, referring \\nto how she and her friends protect each other.   aWe also often restrict ourselves from going alone to some places.a   Almost\\n every one of her friends has experienced sexual harassment. \\naPreviously, people would not discuss this. I see the change coming. We \\nnow come across rape cases each and every day a people are more \\neducated, they are realising this is a serious issue.a   Yet, there \\nis a long way to go, she says. Thakur and many of her friends are \\nfrustrated by how slow the justice system works in cases of sexual \\nviolence.   Court cases can drag on for many years and suspects are often granted bail.   aThese things should be faster and proper punishment should be implemented,a she says. aPeople would fear it more.a   Thakur hopes more parents will encourage their daughters to take \\nself-defence classes and to discuss their problems openly, while \\nallowing them more freedom to go out and protest.   In recent months, women have been at the forefront of several anti-government protests in places such as India and Hong Kong.   Despite some cultural shifts, Thakur still fears for her future as a woman.   After graduating this May, she intends to apply for a masteras degree in business administration and then pursue a PhD.   Thakur\\n is aware she will be pressured into getting married by the end of her \\nstudies. aPeople expect a lot out of a woman. My future will depend on \\nthe kind of people I will be surrounded with, if I can go abroad or \\noutside my city. It will depend on the kind of husband I will have. I am\\n scared as hell because of those things.a    MARRIAGE EXPECTATIONS    In\\n Vietnam, Tra My Tran, 30, is feeling the pressure to get married and \\ngive birth. While her mother supported her in pursuing her education and\\n professional dreams a even when that was frowned upon by neighbours who\\n thought she should find a husband instead a she began feeling pressure \\nfrom her family last year.   aIn the last months of 2019, my mum kept asking me and telling me \\nabout the importance of a relationship and getting married,a says Tran, \\nwho coordinates the psychology department at the non-profit Blue Dragon \\nChildrenas Foundation.   Tran says she plans to get married but not just yet, despite warnings anot to leave it too latea.   She says many like her are trapped by high expectations. aWe need to be the perfect woman, the perfect role model in all areas.a   Pan\\n Wang, senior lecturer in Chinese and Asian Studies at the University of\\n New South Wales, Australia, says that in Chinaas urban areas amany \\nwomen have become so-called aleftover womena because they can hardly \\nfind a compatible marriage partner due to their age, with most in their \\n30s, high educational attainment and economic independencea.   aThis situation is worsened when men look to amarry downa and women amarry upa,a says Wang.    TURNING POINT    Tran,\\n who lives in Hanoi, Vietnamas capital, says those surrounding her are \\nincreasingly aware of womenas rights. aI can see we are at a turning \\npoint. There is a behaviour change in my generation. More men are now \\nwilling to do house work and share child-caring responsibilities.a   But\\n Tran says there continues to be discrimination against women in the \\nworkplace, with some fearing they will lose their job if they take \\nmaternity leave.   She says the way women are perceived and their \\naccess to opportunities remain unequal in parts of the country. aThere \\nis still this perception that the wife is the one taking orders. Many \\nbecome victims of violence. And women often blame themselves for not \\nmeeting the expectations of their fathers, boyfriends, husbands,a says \\nTran, who works with human-trafficking survivors.   aAnother issue \\namong many ethnic minorities is that the right of education for girls is\\n still not upheld and we see many early marriages. They are the most \\nvulnerable,a says Tran, who has come across women pushed into marriages \\nwhen they were 13 years old.   Wang, the researcher, says feminist movements struggle to reach rural parts of neighbouring China.   aItas\\n difficult for large numbers of illiterate women in rural China to \\ndisclose sexual misconduct by men. One reason is that many do not see \\nthis as a problem. The other is that some are too afraid to speak out \\nand donat know how to speak out.a   Although Chinaas #MeToo campaign\\n is growing, Wang says, ait is not quite a movement yet as itas limited \\nin scale and has to be carried out in hidden forms, for example, using \\ncoded messages and homophone hashtags such as #ricebunny [spoken in \\nChinese as mi tu] to circumvent government censorshipa.    MENSTRUATION RIGHTS    The urban-rural dichotomy is felt elsewhere, too, including in Nepal, the home of Sharmila Dhungana, 25.   She\\n was born in the western part of the country in a buffalo shed. Things \\nhave improved since then, but some people living in rural areas continue\\n to uphold superstitions and cultural norms that dictate the place of \\nwomen in society.   When Dhungana, a climate change researcher for an intergovernmental \\ncentre in Asia, began menstruating, she tried to keep it to herself. But\\n her mother eventually found out. aI was in this isolated room for like \\n13 days,a she recalls. aI was told then that I should not look at my \\nbrother or father, only after taking a bath a because itas purifying. \\nShouldnat touch the plants or sit on the sofa.a   Dhungana, who now \\nlives in Nepalas capital Kathmandu, has since graduated in public health\\n from the Asian University for Women in Bangladesh and has travelled to \\nother countries.   She realises how deeply rooted the traditions \\naround menstruation are in some parts of Nepal. aI am still supposed to \\nwear a separate set of clothes and not enter the kitchen. But now I \\noften say that I just forgot,a she says, explaining that one of her ways\\n is to push for change within her own family every time she visits them.\\n aI also have open conversations about it with my siblings [a younger \\nsister and brother] and cousins,a she says.   aIf I have a daughter,\\n I will never put her through this. This will stop,a says Dhungana, who \\nhas led workshops teaching village children about menstruation.   In\\n recent years, the government has taken measures to uproot the \\namenstruation hutsa where women are required to sleep during their \\nperiods in some western parts of the country.   Some have died due \\nto the dire conditions in the huts. But despite the authoritiesa \\nattempts, many residents are resisting the change.   Dhungana, who \\nhas taken part in several female-led initiatives, says that feminism is \\nrising in Nepal. aBut talking and doing is a different thing,a she says.\\n aThe society has been structured patriarchally and there is still this \\nsense of entitlement [among men].a   She says the conversation needs to be broader and include people of different regions, casts and social backgrounds.   Dhungana\\n was brought up with the idea that a womanas role is to care for others.\\n aThe ambitions of my motheras generation were building a house, giving \\neducation to their children. But I never saw my mum having individual \\ndreams.a   Dhungana a who won a solo travel challenge for women in \\nNepal a says although she grapples with social expectations, she wonat \\ngive up on carving dreams of her own. aThis is why I find financial \\nindependence and learning about myself so important. Travelling is, for \\nme, a way to understand the world and myself.a    CONCEPTS OF MOTHERHOOD    In\\n Hong Kong, Circle Yuen, 35, hopes that when her two young daughters, \\naged two and nine, reach adulthood they will encounter less prejudice in\\n society.   aI hope they get to be true to themselves. It may sound easy, but itas so hard.a   Yuen,\\n born and raised in the city, knows what she is talking about. She and \\nher former partner broke up when their daughter was only two. After a \\nseries of heated arguments, Yuen realised they could not live together, \\nbut she did not know what to do next.   aWhen I faced this problem, \\nit was so hard to seek help and talk to people. Very luckily I walked \\ninto a bookstore and saw a co-parenting communication handbook. I did \\nnot know what that was,a she recalls.   Yuen, who eventually got \\nseparated, says pressure from society made her personal struggle even \\nharder. aMy daughter was living in our house with her dad, and my \\ngrandmother kept asking why I had left my daughter. At the time, I \\nthought I had to take the blame. I believed I was not as good a mother \\nas they were,a Yuen recalls.   She has found more healthy ways to \\ncommunicate with her former partner. aI am still learning,a she says. \\naBut I can say that I walked through the marriage storm and got more \\nconfident.a   On the way, she has grown as a community leader while being a wife \\nand a mother, says Yuen, who was a fellow with Hong Kong-based \\nnon-profit Resolve.   aThey got me a mentor who shared an important thought with me: we may see our story as shame, but others see it as courage.a   Yuen,\\n who has had a second daughter with her current partner, now dedicates \\nmost of her time to an independent project about co-parenting, which has\\n included producing books, community theatre and educational programmes.   Although\\n divorce rates have gone up, she says athere is still a lot of invisible\\n pressure deeply rooted in Chinese and other Asian culturesa.   Yuen,\\n who previously worked for an advocacy group against sexual violence, \\nsays gender inequality has led to suffering among both women and men. \\naBut perhaps women go through more self-blaming because of the \\ntraditional ways of perceiving motherhood,a she says. aMany female \\nsurvivors of domestic violence also have a harder time to deal with \\ntheir partners and to find a solution for their relationship.a   She\\n says athe concept of a broken family needs to be rewritten. It should \\nbe seen as a reformed family or a restructured familya.    LESBIAN AND MIGRANT    Jhic Dacio, from the Philippines, agrees that traditional concepts of family and gender need to be scrapped.   She\\n has lived in Hong Kong since 2002 as a domestic worker and is the sole \\nbreadwinner of her family. Dacio, 45, says she has felt several forms of\\n discrimination in the city. aI have gone through some uncomfortable \\nsituations in the streets here, especially when I am holding hands with \\nmy partner. Some people stare at us,a says Dacio, a lesbian.   She \\nhas also experienced discrimination within the community of domestic \\nworkers in the city, who are mostly from the Philippines and Indonesia. \\naSome people make nasty comments, things like aa lesbian canat give a \\ngood family or a babya,a she says.   Her sexual preferences are not the only reason she has felt excluded \\nat times. aRacism is still around,a she says. On top of that, domestic \\nworkers a largely under-represented in recent feminist movements a also \\nface systemic forms of discrimination that stem, in Dacioas opinion, \\nfrom insufficient protection provided by the government.   Marie \\nSegrave, an associate professor in criminology at Monash University, \\nsays across Asia low-skilled female migrants tend to have limited \\noptions ato secure their own safety and to bring to the fore experiences\\n of abuse or exploitation running from the context of intimate partner \\nrelationships to the workplacea.   In Singapore, female migrant \\ndomestic workers are among the groups most vulnerable to gender-based \\nviolence and discrimination, along with family caregivers, single \\nmothers and foreign spouses and children, says Shailey Hingorani, head \\nof research and advocacy for the non-profit Aware.   The researcher \\nsays that although Singaporean women receive the same opportunities as \\nmen in education and when entering the workforce, atraditional gender \\nrolesa still determine who aperforms unpaid domestic or caregiving \\nworka.   For instance, the workforce participation drops sharply for\\n women once they hit their 30s, which is when many have children. In \\n2018, women in Singapore earned 16.3 per cent less than men when \\ncomparing the median pay between both genders. These are among the \\nfactors, Hingorani says, that aresult in many women in Singapore ageing \\ninto povertya.   According to Aware, sexual violence cases involving\\n technology a such as cyber harassment, voyeurism and non-consensual \\ndistribution of intimate images a almost tripled from 2016, when 46 were\\n reported, to 124 in 2018.    OUT LOUD    The \\n2020 Asia Girls Report and Girlsa Leadership Index a which analysed 19 \\ncountries on aspects such as education and political voice a put \\nSingapore, the Philippines and Vietnam in the top three positions.   aThere\\n is still no country in the world where girls and women are equal to \\nboys and men. Asian countries are no exception. But we have the \\nresources and expertise to do better, we just need to make it a \\npriority,a says Bhagyashri Dengle, regional director of the charity Plan\\n International Asia-Pacific.   Sara Davies, an Australia-based \\ninternational relations professor focused on women, peace and security, \\nsays the increased rates of female participation in formal employment \\nare expected to bring amassive shiftsa to employment relations, \\ndiscrimination laws and wages in Asia. aThis will not happen overnight \\nbut it is happening. As more women enter the formal workforce, societies\\n cannot continue to accept or tolerate violence against women for \\ntravelling at night, for what they wear, etc,a she says.   Dacio, \\nwho set up Share Hong Kong a a group that organises activities for \\nmigrants a says women in both developed and developing nations need to \\nfight sexism.   aThe sending-away culture of my country is not fair \\nfor women,a she says, referring to the thousands of female migrants who \\nwork abroad and live apart from their families to send money back to the\\n Philippines.   aThen, in their workplaces, many are sexually \\nharassed and even raped,a the domestic worker says. aAnd the problem in \\ncities like Hong Kong is that victims are silent because they have \\nlimited access to an assistance network.a   Despite all the challenges, Dacio has no doubts that women are the backbone of Asia: aWe need to keep speaking up.a    \\n            Microsoft may earn an Affiliate Commission if you purchase something through recommended links in this article\\n          ', '     A visitor walks past a brine lake at a lithium mine on the Atacama salt flat in the Atacama Desert, Chile.

A\\n new filtration technique could cut the time needed to produce lithium \\nraw materials at South Americaas vast evaporation ponds to hours from \\nmonths, according to a study by a group of international scientists.   The method, developed by researchers at Australiaas national \\nscience institute CSIRO, Monash University, the University of Melbourne \\nand the University of Texas at Austin, mimics the filtering capabilities\\n of living cells to extract lithium from concentrated salt water, where \\nthe metal is typically mixed with other materials, including potassium \\nand salt.   aWe could one day have the capability to produce simple \\nfilters that will take hours to extract lithium from brine, rather than \\nseveral months to years,a said Huanting Wang, a professor of chemical \\nengineering at Monash University, and among the authors of newly \\npublished research on the technique.   Early studies indicate about \\n90% of contained lithium can be recovered using the filter system, \\ncompared to about 30% when producers use the existing process of pumping\\n brines into a series of ponds and allowing the sun to evaporate the \\nliquid for as long as 18 months, according to the researchers. Fort \\nLauderdale-based Energy Exploration Technologies Inc., which is seeking \\nto commercialize the technology, says the process can also   cut refining costs  by about half.       Lithium,\\n key for rechargebale batteries that power electric cars, is currently \\nmainly produced either by refining spodumene, a mineral typically \\nextracted from hard rock mines in Australia, or by processing salty \\nbrines found predominantly in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia.   Though lithium prices have tumbled since mid-2018 as a raft \\nof new mine projects have lifted supply and amid weaker demand in China,\\n suppliers are focused on developing more efficient production \\ntechniques ahead of a forecast demand revival from about 2023, according\\n to BloombergNEF.

A\\n Sydney doctor have called for businesses and education facilities to go\\n into lockdown to reduce the number of new cases, which have climbed to \\n92 nationwide. Pictured are people wearing face masks on Monday   'We\\n should close schools, universities and many businesses to reduce new \\ncases, enable preparations, ramp up arrangements for protective and \\nsupportive equipment, increase capacity in hospitals, free and create \\nICU beds for life support,' Dr Hull wrote.   'People half-expect strong government action similar to other affected countries .'   'To\\n protect everyone, especially the elderly and vulnerable, we should \\nright now isolate people at home for two weeks, to try to contain \\nspread.\\xa0   'Two weeks now will be difficult and expensive, but at least most people will be well.'   Dr Hull added taking this action will be much harder to do later.   'Committing\\n to isolation to slow spread at this critical stage, and reducing close \\ncontact when possible, may help us to manage the weeks and months before\\n we have a vaccine, or forms of treatment, to lessen the impact,' she \\nsaid.   \\xa0The\\n Prime Minister is pleading with Australia's biggest companies to avoid \\nretrenching their workers as coronavirus hammers the economy.   Scott Morrison asked bosses: 'Hold on to your people.'   He\\n also said coronavirus could be worse than the Global Financial Crisis \\nof more than a decade ago, with Australia now even more reliant on China\\n for exports.   'The Global Financial Crisis was centred in the \\nnorth Atlantic... this crisis is much closer to home,' he told The \\nAustralian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney on Tuesday.   Mr\\n Morrison begged employers to be kind to their staff as his government \\nprepared to unveil a $10billion economic stimulus package that is set to\\n include one-off payments to pensioners and Newstart unemployment \\nrecipients.   Small business operators are also set to receive sweeteners to keep staff employed during these uncertain times.   The\\n measures will be designed to ward off an economic downturn with \\nmemories still fresh of the GFC, which saw 223,900 Australians lose \\ntheir jobs between 2008 and 2014.\\xa0    Dr Hull also recalled when she immediately went into isolation  seven days after she'd last seen her sick colleague.      Aged\\n in her 60s, she was particularly concerned as she's asthmatic and \\nallergic to medications that may be needed for secondary infections.    'Those\\n who had shared that shift were quarantined. Because we were very busy \\nand working in separate spaces that evening, I did not have much \\nexposure to our sick doctor. But how much is enough?,' Dr Hull wrote.   'Isolation\\n after exposure is scary because there is time to consider the risks. \\nThat leads to worrying days of information gathering, sharing and \\noverload, pondering any slight change in our bodies and enduring long \\nanxious nights.'

[+]   used properly could help alert users of potential dangers.     On Wednesday the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic \\n a the first time such a declaration has been made since the H1N1 crisis\\n in 2009, which saw nearly a quarter of the world\\'s population infected.\\n  COVID-19,\\n the disease that is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been detected \\nin more than 100 nations around the globe according to WHO , which \\nannounced earlier in the week that it was detected in Bulgaria, Costa \\nRica, French Guiana, the Maldives, Malta and Martinique.    The spread of the illness has been tracked worldwide, and its impact noted by American management consulting firm  McKinsey and Company .\\n The firm noted the critical indicators of the impact of COVID-19, and \\nfound that countries such as South Korea and Italy have seen cases grow \\nand health care systems stretched. It also warned that global GDP in \\n2020 could slide or fall sharply due to the outbreak.     Social Media Tracking    Social media has been an instrumental component of the data \\nalgorithms being used to track COVID-19\\'s global impact. According to  recent data from Hootsuite Insights, powered by Brandwatch , in just one month the term \"coronavirus\" surpassed over 19 million Twitter mentions in the United States.   In the same period the mentions only reached 2.6 million the U.K., \\nwhich suggested that social media sentiment remained more neutral in the\\n U.K. than the U.S., but also highlighted that disgust was the top U.S. \\nemotion, with fear continuing on an uphill rise.    \"While thousands have been confirmed with the virus, hundreds of \\nmillions have been infected/affected with the dread and uncertainty,\" \\nexplained  Mike Berland, an ex-political pollster and founder/CEO of NY-based data insights firm Decode_M , who has used data science to track the spread of COVID-19.   \"The emotional and business impact currently exceeds the rate of known infection,\" added Berland, author of upcoming book   Maximum Momentum  .\\n \"But the uncertainty is paralyzing and itas influenced markets and \\nbehavior. You can\\'t see it; you can only feel it. We\\'re in a rare \\nsituation when everyone in the world is directing its attention on the \\nsame concern, and everybody is equally impacted. In any situation, \\nuncertainty always has momentum.\"   Data science from social media could do more than just help track the\\n spread of the disease, and when used properly could help alert users of\\n potential dangers.   \"Momentum of the coronavirus conversation was first driven by online \\nnew sites and message boards. That remains where most of the \\nconversation is,\" explained Berland. \"As awareness has spread and \\nindividuals are engaging more, there has been a recent surge in momentum\\n from social media sites.\"    Two\\n researchers from Monash University a Mark Andrejevic, professor of \\ncommunications and media studies, and Neil Selwyn, professor of \\neducation a published a paper  this week that showed how smartphones \\ncould aid in data tracking, where the handsets could be \"repurposed as \\nmonitoring systems to support the management and control of the public.\"   The researchers noted that smartphones were not only used to share \\nfacts and information about COVID-19 to the public, but also provided \\ninformation about the public to authorities, which in turn could help \\nmanage and even control its spread.    An Anti-Social Network    One of the most effective ways that mobile devices have been used to \\nmonitor the populace is via the Chinese Health Code program, which can \\nalso be accessed via the popular wallet app Alipay or on platforms such \\nas WeChat. It has provided the government with a way to monitor citizens\\n to assess risk and even determine quarantine status.   The app provides users with information on whether they\\'re allowed to\\n leave homes, use mass transit or whether their respective risk level \\nhas consigned them to quarantine. Users are categorized a green, yellow \\nor red a based on their medical conditions as well as travel history.   A similar app was developed by Chinese-based Tencent for the southern\\n city of Shenzhen, and this software also has been used to determine \\nwhether a person should be allowed to travel in public or should be \\nplaced in public.    However, there are concerns of how much these \"anti-social media\" programs take the monitoring.  Earlier this month,  The New York Times ,\\n which analyzed the software code of these apps, found that the \\ninformation gathered could be shared with the police or other \\nauthorities . It could set \"template for new forms of automated \\nsocial control that could persist long after the epidemic subsides,\" \\nwarned the paper of record.\\xa0   These social media tools could be just the beginning of what we could see come about because of this crisis.   \"Obviously, we don\\'t associate a viral epidemic with innovation, but \\nthink of it this way,\" added Berland. \"It\\'s a novel problem for our \\ntimes that forces new accommodations.\"  ', \"    Published:    21:16 AEDT, 13 March 2020     |    Updated:    23:36 AEDT, 13 March 2020        Hundreds of people queued for hours outside a fever clinic to get tested for  coronavirus  on Friday as one person was wheeled out by paramedics in biohazard suits.

On this week\\'s Tech Tent, we find out about the apps \\nthat are monitoring people with the virus and look at whether they pose a\\n long-term threat to civil liberties.   In South Korea, the \\nauthorities have created an app that lets them know whether people who \\nshould be in quarantine have broken the rules. In China, the Health Code\\n app, created by the Chinese government and hotted on e-commerce giant \\nAlibaba\\'s Alipay platform, lets users know if they are allowed to leave \\nhome or use public transport. But according to analysis by the New York \\nTimes, signing up to the apps can mean handing over data about your \\nlocation and identity to the police.   Researchers at Australia\\'s Monash University have been looking at how countries are using tech to manage the virus.    \"This\\n is the first pandemic you can access with your smartphone,\" Prof Mark \\nAndrejevic tells us. \"And also the first one in which smartphones are \\nbeing used to track people and monitor them and control their \\nmovements.\"   Of\\n course, what we often fail to realise is that our smartphones and the \\nservices on them have been tracking us for years anyway.   If you \\nare signed in to Google Maps, it may well have a complete record of \\neverywhere you have been for years. If you use an iPhone and store your \\nphotos in the cloud, Apple will also have a good record of your \\nmovements and who you have interacted with.   But in some countries, governments have long wanted to get access to this kind of data - and now they have seized their chance.    In\\n South Korea, they have gone even further than China in acquiring \\ndetailed information about people\\'s movements during this health crisis.\\n Their app tells users about people near them who have been infected, \\nand where they have been.    And that has privacy implications - \\nalthough the information is anonymised it may not be too difficult for \\neither app users or the police to work out exactly who each flashing dot\\n on the map turns out to be.    Once the system has been put in place,  it could \\ncontinue to be used after this crisis is over. \"There\\'s no reason why \\nyou couldn\\'t use it for the annual flu season, for example,\" says Prof \\nAndrejevic    \"I do think it\\'s possible that we might find our \\nconcern about the use of information lowered by these moments where \\nbecause of an exceptional circumstance, all of a sudden this data is \\nbeing mobilised.\"   In the UK, representatives from Google, \\nFacebook, Amazon, Palantir and other tech companies were summoned to \\nDowning Street to be asked what they could contribute to the battle \\nagainst the virus.  The discussions centred around how they could \\nprovide data and expertise to help the National Health Service manage \\nwhat could be a surge in demand.   There is no indication yet that \\nthe UK government is considering monitoring infected people via an app. \\nBut as the crisis deepens, all countries will face the same dilemma - \\nhow much of our privacy are we willing to sacrifice in the battle to \\nkeep us healthy?

Another 23 cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in Victoria overnight, taking the state\\'s total number of positive tests to 94.

Victorian Chief Health \\nOfficer Brett Sutton says the decision not to close schools was based on\\n how the disease presented in children, and to avoid busy health and \\nemergency workers being forced to look after their children.   It comes as non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people have been banned.   Mr Andrews insists it\\'s the right call.   \"I\\n know many, many parents are anxious, they\\'re concerned, and I know to a\\n certain extent it\\'s a bit counterintuitive that schools remain open,\" \\nhe told reporters on Tuesday.   \"But the advice is, closing schools\\n now - that\\'s not to say they won\\'t close at some stage in the future - \\nbut if we were to close them now, across the board, that could make a \\nvery difficult set of circumstances even worse.   \"It could do more harm than good.\"   Victorian\\n Education Minister James Merlino said the advice is that it is best to \\nclose schools closer to the peak of the infection.   If government schools are closed down, teachers will continue to be paid and will keep working on their laptops, he said.

Iam itching to leave a party by \\n11pm; she is just warming up. Itas pretty clear that Iam a lark; Clare \\nis an owl.\\xa0   The extent to which you are owl-ish or \\nlark-oriented is called your achronotypea, and it is something that is \\nrooted in your genes.\\xa0   Some people leap out of bed in \\nthe morning, raring to go.

These involve making sure you eat \\nthe right food, at the right time, and that you get exposure to strong \\nenough light, again at the right time.   All this week in the Daily Mail I have been serialising my brilliant new book,  Fast Asleep , which brings together the latest scientifically proven ways to improve sleep.   If\\n you sleep badly, thereas every chance your clock has become disrupted, \\nbut the really good news is that it can be changed to improve your sleep\\n quality, and Iall show you how. Oddly enough, your circadian clock \\ndoesnat follow a day that is exactly 24- hours long. Some peopleas clock\\n runs fast, othersa runs slow.\\xa0   If you have a fast clock then\\n that means you are a lark a you like to get up early. If you have a \\nslow clock then you are an owl, someone who likes to stay up late.\\xa0   A\\n while ago I did a genetic test which confirmed what I had long \\nsuspected: that I am one of those people whose circadian clock is a \\nlittle fast.\\xa0   However, if your sleep isnat as great as\\n youad want, or if, like me, youave suffered from insomnia for years, it\\n is important to understand whether you are more lark or owl   I\\n also have a marker for increased risk of insomnia and one which is \\nassociated with poor sleep efficiency in people who are exposed to high \\nlevels of work-related stress.\\xa0   All this knowledge is fine if\\n you live a rarefied life which allows you to go to bed and wake up when\\n your clock demands it.\\xa0   However, in the real world we often \\nhave to get up horribly early when our body would much rather be asleep,\\n or work late at night when every cell in your body is screaming for \\nsleep.\\xa0   Pushing your natural chronotype beyond its boundaries\\n night after night can easily disrupt your circadian rhythm, ruining \\nyour sleep and putting you at risk of insomnia.\\xa0   This is \\nimportant, because when your biological clocks get\\xa0out of sync with\\n the outside world, and with each other, you are in trouble.\\xa0   Not\\n only will you struggle to sleep, but you will get hungry, have problems\\n controlling your blood sugar levels, feel run down and tired, and find \\nit hard to concentrate.\\xa0   Itas called asocial jet laga, \\nbecause just like the jet lag you experience after travelling across \\nmultiple time zones, it leaves you feeling terrible.    WHY DO CHILDREN WAKE EARLY?    A\\n big study of 25,000 people of all ages found that while most children \\nare larks, they become progressively more owlish through the teenage \\nyears, hitting maximum aowla at around 20.\\xa0   They try to sneak\\n their phones up to their bedrooms, stay up late chatting to their \\nfriends on social media and are hard to rouse in the morning.\\xa0   They\\n grunt at breakfast, refuse your healthy offerings and instead buy junk \\nfood and energy drinks on the way to school to wake themselves up.\\xa0   This\\n behaviour might be really annoying but, to some extent, itas not their \\nfault. Puberty shifts the internal clock to a later setting, by an \\naverage of one to two hours.\\xa0   So an angelic child who was \\nonce quite happy to go to bed by 9.30pm and get up at 7am (getting the \\nnecessary ten hours in bed) suddenly morphs into a stroppy teenager who \\nresents being sent to bed at all and resents even more getting up at \\n7am, after having managed less than seven hoursa sleep.\\xa0   One\\n of the main things that keeps people awake at night is worrying about \\nstaying awake and the terrible consequences of not getting to sleep \\n(file photo)   There are clear gender differences too. Girls, \\nwho tend to hit puberty earlier than boys, start turning owlish earlier,\\n reaching amaximum owla at 19, before slowly becoming more \\nlarkish.\\xa0   Boys, on the other hand, have a body clock that \\ntends to get them to bed later and later, until they hit the age of 21 \\nand have to fit into the adult world. ANonetheless, they tend to remain \\nmore owlish than women until they hit their 50s, when gender differences\\n disappear.\\xa0   This might cause conflict at home, but perhaps this is what nature intended.\\xa0   When\\n kids are young, it is vital that their parents nurture and look after \\nthem. But as they grow older, they need to start to assert their own \\nidentity, to prepare for life outside the parental home, where they will\\n have to fend for themselves.\\xa0   Staying up late, with other \\nteenagers, while the parents are all asleep, may be natureas way of \\nbonding the next generation together.\\xa0    DON'T WORRY ABOUT STAYING AWAKE    One\\n of the main things that keeps people awake at night is worrying about \\nstaying awake and the terrible consequences of not getting to \\nsleep.\\xa0   Thoughts like: aI wonat get to sleep and if I donat then I will feel really tired at work tomorrow and get the sack.a\\xa0   Itas important to realise that these thoughts are not real. Try giving your negative thoughts a name, like aDonalda.\\xa0   So when you have them you can say: aThat is just Donald sounding off again.a\\xa0   Challenging yourself like this sounds crazy, but it works.\\xa0   Another\\n way of approaching your catastrophic or negative thoughts is by \\nimagining what a sympathetic friend would say to you if you were to \\nshare them. What would they say? How would they help to ground \\nyou?\\xa0   It is also important to realise that at night your \\nfilters are down, and you are more vulnerable to inner demons, so any \\nthoughts you might have at night will inevitably be less rooted in \\nreality than the negative thoughts you have during the day.\\xa0   But once your sleep improves, you will find those negative thoughts easier to stamp out.\\xa0    Say no to cocoa    Any\\n fat you consume will also cause fat levels in your blood to rise \\nfurther and faster than they would earlier in the day and take longer to\\n fall (file photo)    A cup of hot chocolate or a bowl of cereal just before bed may sound soothing but actually it is a bad idea.\\xa0     Your\\n pancreas (which produces insulin) will have closed down for the night, \\nso it wonat be ready for the big sugar hit that cereal or cocoa will \\ndeliver. This will cause your blood sugars to rise and keep on rising \\ninto the night, which is bad for sleep as well as for your body.\\xa0     Any\\n fat you consume will also cause fat levels in your blood to rise \\nfurther and faster than they would earlier in the day and take longer to\\n fall. A few years ago, I did an experiment on myself in which I ate \\nexactly the same high-fat, high-carb meal at 10am and 10pm.\\xa0     Whereas\\n my fat and blood sugar levels rose and fell quite quickly after the \\nmorning meal, in the evening they were both still rising well after \\nmidnight.\\xa0     Another good reason to avoid a \\nlate-night snack or glass of milk is that any protein in the food will \\ncause your stomach to release acid. Particularly if you suffer from acid\\n reflux, itas advisable to stay away from anything but water in the two \\nhours running up to bedtime.    Once you have given your diet a\\n more Mediterranean twist, increasing your intake of vegetables and \\npulses that your gut bacteria love (as explained in Tuesdayas paper), \\nand you have created the perfect bedtime routine (as I outlined \\nyesterday), you might find the suggestions I make below are enough to \\nsignificantly improve your sleep quality.\\xa0   Thatas because one\\n of the most important drivers of sleep is your circadian rhythm. This \\nis a 24- hour internal clock which runs in the background of your brain,\\n cycling between sleepiness and alertness at regular intervals.    Anyone can become a morning person     You really can turn yourself from an owl into a lark in just three weeks a and without medical intervention.\\xa0     You\\n just need to reset your internal clocks by controlled and strategic \\nexposure to light and the timing of your meals. This should make it \\neasier for you to fall asleep at night, and ensure you are more alert \\nand energetic during the day.\\xa0     Thatas because your main internal clock, the one in the centre of your brain, is mainly controlled by light.\\xa0     Rays\\n of light from the sun hit receptors in the back of your eyes that send \\nmessages to a tiny region of the brain (called the suprachiasmatic \\nnucleus or SCN) which control our circadian rhythms.\\xa0    Like light and darkness, when you eat has a powerful effect on re-synchronising your body clocks, too (file photo)    The\\n light triggers signals to other parts of your body, including your \\nguts, letting them know that a new day has begun and it is time to get \\nmoving. The SCN also raises your core body temperature before you wake, \\nso you are ready to get going.\\xa0     What makes \\nthings a bit more complicated is the fact that each of our organs has \\nits own clock, which is linked to the main clock but not necessarily \\ndriven by it. The clock in your liver, for example, is not reset by \\nlight, but by when you eat.\\xa0     Like light and darkness, when you eat has a powerful effect on re-synchronising your body clocks, too.\\xa0     To\\n show it can be done, researchers from Monash University in Australia \\nrecruited 22 owls, men and women who normally go to bed around 2.30am \\nand wake up at 10am.\\xa0     For three weeks they were asked to follow nine simple rules. These were:\\xa0      1.  To wake up at least two hours earlier than normal, which for this group meant getting up by 8am.\\xa0      2.  To get outside and expose themselves to plenty of outdoor light in the mornings.\\xa0      3.  To have breakfast as soon as convenient.\\xa0      4.  To only exercise in the morning.\\xa0      5.  To have lunch at the same time every day.\\xa0      6.  To avoid all caffeine after 4pm.\\xa0      7.  To avoid having a nap after 4pm.\\xa0      8. \\xa0To avoid bright lights during the evening and to head to bed a couple of hours earlier than normal (by about midnight).      9. \\xa0To stick to this regime every day of the week, including weekends.\\xa0     After three weeks, the owls had successfully shifted their body clocks forward by an impressive two hours.\\xa0     Not\\n only were they going to sleep earlier, but tests showed that their \\nlevels of melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone, were peaking two hours \\nearlier.\\xa0     1. Do you wake up bright and cheerful, without an alarm clock, by 7am?     2. If you go to bed at 10pm, do you swiftly fall asleep?\\xa0     3. Do you always try to head to bed before midnight, even if you are on holiday?\\xa0     4. Or do you have trouble falling asleep before midnight?\\xa0     5. Do you need an alarm clock to drag you out of bed in the morning?\\xa0     6. Do you find you donat need to eat until later in the day and are happy with just a coffee?\\xa0     7. Given the chance, would you sleep in till 11am or later?\\xa0     If you answered ayesa to the first three questions and anoa to the last four, you have strong larkish tend     Having shifted their body clocks they felt far less sleepy during the day and were happier with their lives.\\xa0     Their\\n depression and stress scores improved, as did their performance in \\ncognitive tests. They even got physically stronger.\\xa0     This is all part of a pattern I try to follow on a daily basis to keep my circadian rhythms in sync.\\xa0     I\\n set an early alarm (7am), run through a series of resistance exercises \\n(press up and squats) then when I have time I take our dog out for a \\n30-minute walk before breakfast.\\xa0     Part of the \\nbenefit is the exercise, but part is exposing myself to lots of early \\nmorning light which should reset my internal clock and let my body know \\nthe day has begun.\\xa0     During long dark winters I \\nsit and work by a light box just to reinforce those early morning light \\ntriggers (and boost my levels of vitamin D).\\xa0     I \\nonly have coffee before midday, I never nap (even when Iam desperate to \\njust lie down and shut my eyes for a few moments), and I dim the lights \\naround the house in the evening, getting to bed before midnight.\\xa0     If you are really owlish an even quicker way to convert yourself to a lark could be to go camping.\\xa0     A\\n few years ago a U.S. researcher sent eight people on a camping trip \\nwith wrist monitors to record how much light they were being exposed to,\\n and activity monitors to measure how much sleep they were \\ngetting.\\xa0     During the week they were away \\ncamping, they were not allowed torches or mobile phones, and the only \\nlight they saw at night was from candles or the campfire.

Shift work survival guide\\xa0    Any job that involves shift work is likely to be a sleep killer a and the effects can last a lifetime.\\xa0   Jet\\n lag and shift work have a lot in common. In both cases your internal \\nbody clock is thrown out of sync with the external world, and this has a\\n number of unfortunate consequences.\\xa0   In the case of jet lag,\\n the impact can be unpleasant, but it tends not to be long term (unless \\nyou do an awful lot of travelling). For shift workers it can be truly \\nlife-changing. There is a long list of terrible things that prolonged \\nshift work can do to the human body, ranging from increased risk of \\nheart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and obesity, through early \\nmenopause to depression and divorce.\\xa0   There are some people \\nwho cope well with shift work, but being older and female seems to make \\nit harder to adapt. Those over the age of 45 are less able to adapt to \\nshift work, and the impact on their bodies and brains is greater.\\xa0   My son, Jack, is a junior doctor and every few weeks he has to do a couple of nights on call, from 9pm to 9am.\\xa0   Jack\\n has a nap in the afternoon before work, and a meal in the early \\nevening. He also takes food into the hospital to eat before midnight, as\\n the only alternative is something out of a vending machine. He \\npractises time restricted eating (TRE), trying not to eat between \\nmidnight and 9am, when he finishes work.\\xa0   Instead, he drinks \\nlots of water and tea.

He finds that a\\n short nap in the early hours means he feels less tired when driving \\nhome after a night on call.\\xa0   Fortunately, there are things you can do to make shift work more tolerable.\\xa0    TOP TIPS TO KEEP HEALTHY ON SHIFT\\xa0     1. \\xa0Before\\n your shift begins, take a long nap. If you can, try to get the majority\\n of your sleep in the hours leading up to starting your shift.\\xa0   There\\n is evidence that if you are working a night shift, say from 11pm to \\n7am, it is better to have an evening sleep (from 2pm till 9pm) rather \\nthan a morning sleep (8am to 3pm).\\xa0   Put together a bag with \\nhealthy snacks to take with you. The kind of food available from vending\\n machines is likely to be high in sugar, saturated fat and salt, and low\\n in fibre and nutrients.\\xa0   When you eat junk food you pack in \\nthe calories and are soon hungry again. Plus, the fact that you are \\neating at night, when your body will find it hard to process food, means\\n the bad stuff will hang around in your system for longer.\\xa0   So\\n try to eat your main meal before midnight, and take in nuts, apples and\\n pears to snack on if you canat endure a long night without \\nanything.\\xa0   Take in a bottle of water, from the fridge, to sip during overnight shifts. Do not drink caffeinated fizzy drinks.\\xa0    2. \\xa0While\\n youare at work, during the early hours of your night shift, make sure \\nyou are getting exposure to bright light.\\xa0   If your workplace \\nis poorly lit, consider bringing in a light box a such as the Lumie \\nVitamin L SAD light, APS75 from John Lewis a to give yourself a 20-minute \\nblast. It is more effective and certainly healthier than \\ncaffeine.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   Do try TRE. Studies show it is bad for\\n the heart if you eat when your body thinks it should be asleep, and \\nresearchers are currently looking into the health benefits of limiting \\nyour aeating windowa (avoiding eating anything between 1am and 6am) when\\n youare on a night shift.\\xa0   If you get the chance, try to grab a 20 to 40 minute nap at some point during your shift.\\xa0    3. \\xa0When\\n you are travelling home after a night shift wear dark glasses to avoid \\nlight exposure. Rather than going straight to bed, delay your sleep \\nuntil the afternoon if you can, as research shows this is less \\ndisruptive for your body clock.\\xa0   You will probably need ear plugs, a sleep mask and a prominent aDo Not Disturba sign on the bedroom door.\\xa0   You\\n should also pay attention to the classic sleep hygiene routines I \\nrecommended in yesterdayas pull-out (a fixed time when you go to sleep \\nand wake up; a strict countdown to your bedtime routine; no caffeine or \\nalcohol before bedtime).\\xa0    Beware the power of caffeine    Caffeine\\n works by binding to sleep-inducing receptors in your brain that would \\notherwise be occupied by adenosine, the natural hormone which helps you \\nfeel sleepy.\\xa0   If you are feeling sleepy and want to stay \\nawake, you can temporarily block the effects of adenosine with a cup of \\ncoffee. But be warned a relying on caffeine to jolt you awake may mean \\npaying the price in disturbed sleep later.\\xa0   The problem is, \\nsome people metabolise caffeine more efficiently than others. Mostly \\nthis is a matter of genetics, but your ability to sleep after a \\ncaffeine-fuelled day will vary according to gender, age, weight and any \\nmedication you are on.\\xa0   Taking the oral contraceptive Pill, for instance, will dramatically slow your liveras ability to break down caffeine.\\xa0   Caffeine\\n works by binding to sleep-inducing receptors in your brain that would \\notherwise be occupied by adenosine,\\xa0the natural hormone which helps\\n you feel sleepy (file photo)   The average half-life of \\ncaffeine is around five hours, which means that if you have a cup of \\ncoffee at 6pm, half that caffeine will still be running around your \\nsystem at 11pm and a quarter is still there at 4am.\\xa0   If you are sensitive to caffeine, you could be kept awake in the middle of the night by a late-morning cup of coffee.\\xa0   The\\n average half-life of caffeine may be five hours, but the range can vary\\n from just over one hour to up to nine hours. These days, I have two or \\nthree cups of coffee during the morning and rarely drink any after \\nmidday.    Adapted by Louise Atkinson from Fast Asleep.

And trade in high-roller rooms is understood to have been dramatically cut by international travel bans.   But\\n Livingstone, a sociologist and gambling researcher who has long been a \\ncritic of Crown, said the restrictions still left about 1,400 poker \\nmachines operating at the Melbourne casino.

Etiquette\\n experts say being polite is crucial even as COVID-19 prompts health \\nauthorities to encourage a 1.5-metre space between people.   \"We \\ncan social distance in a way that is not offensive, and respectful to \\nothers,\" Australian Finishing School chief executive officer Amanda King\\n told AAP on Thursday.   \"Communicating in a kind, respectful, polite manner.\"   Eye contact, a head nod and smiling could be greeting solutions.   \"Due\\n to this current crisis, rules governing interaction between people are \\nmore relevant than ever,\" the accredited etiquette expert said.   \"We\\n need to be leaders in society with manners and actions around being \\nconsiderate and polite, for example the grocery store hours for \\ndisability and the elderly.\"   Panic buying has cleared supermarket shelves, leaving the vulnerable and elderly unable to buy food and other staples.   Monash\\n University social philosopher Elizabeth Burns Coleman said the social \\nnorms of staying out of people\\'s space had been widened.   \"Politeness is always about being appropriate to a situation,\" Dr Burns Coleman told AAP on Thursday.   \"Clear signal to others what you are doing.

It comes alongside a limit on outdoor gatherings to less than 500 people and indoor gatherings to no more than 100.   Friends keen to meet in person may want to greet with air kissing while colleagues could head nod, Dr Burns Coleman suggested.   \"It should be playful. This is a great time to experiment. Pick up what works,\" she said.   \"We\\n are going to evolve a whole new set of dynamics around social \\ndistancing.

It\\n basically goes like this. A girl who grew up in a small Australian \\ntown\\xa0played every sport under the sun but gravitated\\xa0toward \\ntennis and netball (a game similar to basketball). At college, she \\nmajored in emergency health at Monash University, but the degree may as \\nwell have read \"coaching,\" Marini said. Her dream was to coach the \\nAustralian national netball team.   About a decade ago,\\xa0she met\\n Kieren Marini, an Australian\\xa0who grew up\\xa0watching the NFL \\nwith his dad and is now her husband of nearly five years. At first, both\\n Kieren and Heather assumed her first football game would be her last. \\nShe watched from the sideline\\xa0on a freezing, rainy day.\\xa0   \"She\\n was like, \\'I donat think Iall ever love the sport like you do.\\' Which \\nis kind of funny because of where she is now,\" he said.\\xa0   Kieren said\\xa0the game lasted more than four\\xa0hours; Heather believed\\xa0it was\\xa0closer to five-and-a-half.   aI thought, aThis is the craziest sport Iave ever seen. Iam not sure Iam that interested. Good luck!aa Heather said.\\xa0   As\\n they dated,\\xa0Kieren kept playing, and Heather became a trainer for \\nthe club. Then she advanced to strength and conditioning coach.   aThe more I started\\xa0learning about the sport, the more I got involved,a she said.   In\\n 2010, Marini landed an internship with the\\xa0Oregon State Beavers \\nin\\xa0the strength and conditioning department. She loved it, but her \\nheart wasnat in the weight room. It was on the field.   \"In \\nAustralia, all that strength and conditioning was done out on the field.\\n So we didnat really delineate between sports-specific drills and \\nstrength and conditioning drills,\" Marini said.\\xa0\"I went back to \\nAustralia with that knowledge of, aActually, I want to be on the field.a\\n And I got more and more involved.\"   Back at Monash, she began coaching the U-19 team, with the Warriors finding success as one of the younger teams in the leagues.   Kierenas\\n work as a cancer researcher (he\\xa0holds a PhD and works at the \\nUniversity of California, San Francisco) brought the couple to the \\nU.S.\\xa0As they prepared for the move in 2017, Marini \\nattended\\xa0the NFL Womenas Careers in Football Forum.\\xa0She made \\ntwo life-changing contacts there: NFL senior director \\nSamantha\\xa0Rapoport, who pushed her to apply for jobs,\\xa0and Brown\\n head coach James\\xa0Perry, who was then leading\\xa0Bryant \\nUniversity.\\xa0   It dawned\\xa0on \\nMarini that coaching could be a career rather than a hobby. After all, \\nher coaching efforts in Australia were solely\\xa0volunteer. Once she \\nreceived a working permit in the U.S., she embarked on her \\nown\\xa0coaching tour.   \"I call it my aDIYa internship year,\" \\nMarini said.\\xa0\"I had a lot of coaches that were really supportive of\\n me and let me come to practice and sit and watch film and all that sort\\n of thing. Met a lot of folks, went to a lot of clinics.\"\\xa0\\xa0   She\\n broke into the professional ranks in 2018 by earning a pro scouting \\nfellowship with the New York Jets, spending six weeks with the team \\nbefore the season started.

Universities across the country are still \\ngrappling with how to continue teaching during the crisis, after the \\nfederal government firmly advised them on Wednesday that auniversity and\\n higher education should continue at this time with risk mitigation \\nmeasuresa.   The sector already faces a massive financial hit, with \\nanalysis in the very early stages of Covid-19 suggesting the top 10 \\nuniversities would lose $1.2bn due to Chinese student travel bans alone.\\n The situation has prompted serious concerns for the future of casual \\nacademic staff.   A host of universities a the  University of Queensland ,  University of Melbourne ,  University of Adelaide ,  University of Wollongong  and  University of Technology Sydney ,\\n among others a are rushing to transition their courses online. The \\nAustralian National University is pausing its teaching for a week from \\nMonday and says it is astopping face-to-face teaching for lectures and \\nmoving to remote participationa.   The UQ vice-chancellor, Peter \\nHA,j, told students in an email late on Sunday that it would temporarily \\ncancel all coursework after a fourth confirmed case on the campus.   aThis is a big call, and not one I have taken lightly,a HA,j wrote to students.   The University of Sydney and  Southern Cross University  have each committed to delivering all of their classes remotely from Monday.   But\\n others are pressing on with some form of face-to-face teaching of \\nlectures and other classes, albeit with risk mitigation measures, \\nincluding  Monash University .   The  University of Western Australia \\n says on its website that it is continuing to aoperate as normal and our\\n academic calendar is unchangeda. It also announced it is moving all \\nlectures and tutorials and, where possible, practical classes to online \\ndelivery mode until further notice from Monday.   The approach to \\nstaff leave has also been disjointed. Some universities are providing \\naffected staff with special coronavirus leave, others are telling staff \\nto use their existing personal and annual leave.   At the University\\n of Sydney, Nick Riemer, a senior lecturer in English and linguistics, \\nsaid teaching staff had found themselves rushing to prepare for online \\nclasses while also juggling the concerns of students. He said there was \\nawidespread concerna across campus about the implications of the virus \\nfor teaching and professional staff long-term.   aIt has been fairly chaotic and there are all these intense extra demands being placed on staff,a he said.   aThis\\n semester I have less than 80 students and there is still a quite \\nsignificant extra time burden placed on my work [but] colleagues who are\\n running much larger lecture programs have reported exponentially higher\\n workload.a   Riemer also said he was concerned that aemergency \\nmeasuresa put in place during the crisis a including extra working from \\nhome demands a would become anormaliseda, as well as fears for \\nprofessional and casual staff at the university.   aThereas an enormous amount of concern about the implications for the amount of work available for those staff,a he said.   The response of the University of the Sunshine Coast, which had to  conduct deep cleaning \\n following a visit from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, two \\nweeks ago, has prompted a particularly angry response from staff.   The\\n university on Friday announced it would pause coursework teaching and \\nassessments for a week from Monday, to give it time to redesign its \\ncourses to support online delivery and social distancing.   But \\nearlier in the week, it told staff to reverse plans they had already \\ndeveloped to deliver the vast majority of their courses online.   On\\n Wednesday, senior leadership at the university wrote to the school and \\nordered it to retract the plans and return to face-to-face teaching, \\nciting the advice of the federal government.   The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) described the decision as anutsa and deeply irresponsible.   aFor\\n the University of the Sunshine Coast to say we were ready to have \\nonline delivery for some of our subjects but actually weare going to \\nreturn to our normal timetabled operations, that is just nuts,a the \\nunionas Queensland secretary, Michael McNally, told the Guardian.   aThereas\\n no reason for that. Many universities are actively trying to put their \\nstuff online, for the simple reason that even if universities arenat \\nclosed, it reduces the risk to the community to deliver as much of the \\nteaching as possible online.a   It also appears to run  counter to the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee , which on Wednesday said it supported universities using as much online teaching as possible.   aGiven\\n the demonstrated feasibility of online delivery of lecture content, we \\nsupport universities and higher education centres moving to an online \\nplatform, where appropriate, for continuity of student education,a the \\ncommittee said.   The shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, advised universities to use acommon sensea as they continue operations.   aI\\n would expect and trust that universities, that while theyare exempt, \\nare nevertheless applying some common sense in minimising any \\nunnecessary gatherings of large numbers of people, whether itas less \\nthan 100 or more than 100,a Bowen told the ABC.   The University of \\nthe Sunshine Coast did not respond directly to the NTEUas criticism. But\\n a spokesman said the university was aworking towards what is expected \\nto be a government directive to suspend face-to-face teaching in the \\nnear futurea.   aMuch planning and work in recent weeks have gone \\ninto preparing the university for the delivery of online learning across\\n all disciplines,a he said.   The university has cancelled \\ngraduations, is encouraging students to study online where possible, and\\n is advising social distancing in other face-to-face classes.   Universities\\n Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, acknowledged that the \\ntertiary sectoras response to the virus had varied, but said all \\nuniversities were adhering to advice from officials and praised the \\nfederal government for providing a aclear set of requirementsa.   aThese\\n are prudent, measured steps designed to safeguard students, staff and \\ntheir communities. At the same time, we are trying to minimise \\ndisruption to studentsa education,a she said.   aThings are moving very quickly, and all universities have mobilised staff and students in what is a national effort.   aNone\\n of this is easy and we recognise the challenges faced by our students \\nand staff. But it is vital that as individuals and institutions we work \\ntogether to slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus and protect the \\ncommunity.

There have been 756 infections in Australia and seven deaths since the coronavirus outbreak began   But he added he doubted his ability to give his children the same quality of education their teachers can provide.   Professor\\n of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology at Australian National \\nUniversity Peter Collignon added there was always a risk of infection \\nwhether children went to school or not.\\xa0   Those under the age of 40 have a low risk of death from the disease, Professor Collignon said.\\xa0   Lecturer\\n Paul Kidson, a lecturer in educational leadership at the University of \\nWollongong, meanwhile argued parents should think carefully about \\npulling their children out of school.

The\\n story of last week was several schools announcing cancellation of \\nspring events due to the Coronavirus pandemic. This week, the story was \\nmore of the same, but on a larger scale.   The\\n Pac-12, SEC, ACC, Big 12, AAC and several more schools and conferences \\nannounced that they were cancelling\\xa0or postponing\\xa0all spring \\nevents as well as their spring games due to the virus. It\\'s obviously \\nnot a big surprise because of what\\'s going on right now, but it just \\nillustrates how much things have amplified in the last few \\nweeks.\\xa0Some conferences like the Big Ten have just canceled through\\n the middle of April, but at this point, it sure seems like this is just\\n delaying the inevitable.\\xa0   The\\n loss here -- other than a sense of normalcy for sports fans -- for \\nprograms is really for those schools who have early enrollees (everyone)\\n and those that are looking to break in a new quarterback this spring \\n(several). Those practices are not going to be made up barring something\\n unforeseen, it appears, and assuming the season does start on time, \\nit\\'s entirely possible that we\\'ll see some rustiness/poor quarterback \\nplay early on -- more so than usual, anyway. There are obviously much \\nbigger things going on than this, but it\\'s the reality of the situation.    Heather Marini \\n made history on Monday, being named the first woman to hold a position \\ncoach title in the FCS after she was named the quarterback coach of \\nBrown.   Marini\\n spent last year as an offensive quality coach for the Bears in 2019. \\nPrior to that, she was a scouting assistant for the New York Jets.   Marini,\\n a native of Australia, also played competitively for the Gridiron \\nVictoria Women\\'s team, and she was also a quarterbacks coach/coaching \\ndevelopment assistant for Monash University. She\\'ll have a chance to \\nwork with one of the best quarterbacks in the Ivy League in  E.J. Perry , who threw for 22 touchdowns in 2019 for Brown.\\xa0   It\\'s\\n very, very early in the 2021 recruiting cycle, but assuming you give a \\nsemblance of a care about these things, you have to be impressed with \\nwhat Ohio State is doing.   The Buckeyes added three more four-star recruits this week; cornerback  Jakailin Johnson , safety  Andre Turrentine \\xa0and running back  Evan Pryor . With those two additions and the pledge of  Devonta Smith \\n earlier in March, that gives Ohio State 12\\xa0of the top 300 recruits\\n on ESPN\\'s list. The only schools that come close to that are Clemson \\nwith ten and Florida than nine, and no other school has more than five. \\nThere weren\\'t a lot of doubts that  Ryan Day  was capable of handling the job after  Urban Meyer  retired, but if anyone had any questions about his ability to recruit, they should be answered by now.\\xa0   Ohio State wasn\\'t the only school who added four-star talents this week. Oregon received a verbal commitment from  Ty Thompson ,\\n a 6-foot-4, 200-pound quarterback who is rated the eighth best \\npro-style quarterback by 247Sports and third best prospect out of the \\nstate of Arizona (Mesquite HS, Gilbert). The Tar Heels continue to \\nimpress, and added four-star athlete  Deandre Boykins \\n from Central Cabarrus HS in Concord, North Carolina. The 5-foot-11, \\n200-pound Boykins is capable of playing on both sides of the ball, and \\nit\\'ll be interesting to see where UNC deploys him in 2001.   It would be fair to say that  Dan Mullen \\'s time in Florida has been successful so far, and unsurprisingly, the Gators want to keep the 47-year-old in Gainesville.   Multiple\\n outlets are reporting that Florida and Mullen are working on a contract\\n extension. In his two years at the program, the former Mississippi \\nState coach has gone 21-5 with the Gators, with an 11-5 record in the \\nSEC. He made $6.07 million in 2019, which is the 10th highest figure \\namong all coaches at public institutions. It\\'s just fifth highest in the\\n SEC, however, and it\\'s likely that Mullen will be bumped into the top \\nthree -- assuming this extension gets done, of course.

The 31-year-old, who grew up playing netball and tennis \\nin Victoria\\'s Goulburn Valley, is the first women\\'s position coach in \\nAmerican Division I football.   Marini was dragged to a Monash \\nUniversity gridiron game 12 years ago to watch her future husband play \\nwhich kick-started her amazing journey.   No other Australian has achieved the feat.   \"People\\n respect the fact I have come across the world to follow a passion of \\nmine and therefore they are like, \\'This girl is kind of crazy already so\\n let\\'s give her a chance to see what she can do\\',\" Marini told AAP on \\nSunday from her home in Providence, Rhode Island.   \"If you can \\nprove yourself by working hard then they are going to give you another \\nopportunity which is what happened here at Brown.\"   Marini, as quarterback coach, will oversee the most important position on an American football team.   Brown\\'s star quarterback EJ Perry led the nation and set an Ivy League record for total offence in 2019.   Marini held the title of offensive quality control last season.   \"Heather has earned the coaching position,\" Brown head coach James Perry said.   \"In one season with our program, Heather has done a great job for us.   \"She\\n has proven through her efforts in the office every day with us in an \\noff-the-field role that she\\'s ready to run the quarterback room.\"   Marini\\n was not initially impressed with American football while watching \\nfuture husband, Kieren Marini, play for the Monash Warriors back in the \\nearly days.   As their relationship blossomed Marini, who was \\nstudying for a degree in exercise and sports science and majoring in \\ncoaching, agreed to be the team\\'s unofficial sports trainer.   She \\nthen became strength and conditioning coach and eventually flew to the \\nUS to take up a strength and conditioning internship at Oregon State \\nUniversity.   When Marini returned to Monash she offered her services whenever the Warriors needed it.   \"If\\n the running back coach wasn\\'t there that day I coached running back and\\n over 10 years I coached every offensive position,\" she said.   \"When\\n the club decided they would have a women\\'s team the coach sent me a \\ntext each day saying, \\'No, you\\'re not going to coach you\\'re going to \\nplay quarterback for us\\'.\"   When Kieren Marini moved to the US in \\n2017 to advance his career as a cancer researcher at the University of \\nCalifornia, San Francisco, Marini pursued football coaching \\nopportunities.   She attended the NFL Women\\'s Careers in Football Forum and met future Brown head coach Perry.   In\\n 2018 she earned a professional scouting fellowship with the NFL\\'s New \\nYork Jets and a few months later Perry hired Marini to the offensive \\nquality control position.   Marini said the key to her success is not being shy.   She\\n asked football programs across the US, including Stanford, UC Berkley \\nand UC Davis, if she could shadow their coaching staff.   \"The coaches were open and wonderful,\" she said.   Marini\\'s Australian accent does cause a little confusion.   \"The thing with the accent is when you say over here \\'I coach football\\' they say \\'Oh, you coach rugby\\',\" Marini said.   \"I laugh and say, \\'No, not that either.

Borders are closing to travel even as governments insist \\nthat     cargo and trade \\n will still be allowed to pass. That may be a moot point. Economies \\nrunning into a brick wall tend to see collapses in trade. We learned \\nthat in 2009.   The evidence so far this year from Asian economies like \\nChina, Japan and South Korea that were hit earlier than western ones is \\nthat the coronavirus crisis and the resulting shutting down of industry \\nwill have a     severe impact  on trade no matter what the politicians say.   But what if governments took the next step and decided to \\nhalt trade altogether as part of their efforts to slow the spread the \\nCovid-19 virus? What would be the economic impact then?   In a conversation with the Dartmouth College economic \\nhistorian Douglas Irwin last week, he remembered that work by economists\\n had been done on exactly that. Because thereas an example in U.S. \\neconomic history Irwin has spent some time looking at it as well. (Irwin\\n followed our conversation up with     on Twitter over the weekend.)   At\\n the request of the U.S. Treasury and the Department of Homeland \\nSecurity, a group of economists at Australiaas Monash University in 2012\\n modeled what the economic impact would be of a     of the U.S. border to cargo and people in the event of a public health threat like a pandemic.   They\\n considered various scenarios, the most extreme of which called for the \\ntrade in 95% of goods to be suspended for 12 months. The impact on the \\nU.S. economy? A fall in real gross domestic product of 48%.   There\\n are, of course, fans of greater trade restrictions who would dispute \\nthat finding. There is also an example in American history a albeit one \\nlong before the days of global supply chains a to draw on that points to\\n a milder though significant impact.   In December 1807 the U.S. \\nCongress at President Thomas Jeffersonas urging imposed an embargo on \\ntrade to protest British and French naval harassment that lasted until \\nMarch 1809.   In a   2005 paper ,\\n Irwin calculated that the embargo cost the U.S. 5% of its gross \\nnational product at the time. But it also became as close to a natural \\nexperiment in autarky as the U.S. has ever experienced in peacetime.   As Irwin lays out, the value of U.S. goods exports fell from from  $49 million  in 1807 to  $9 million  in 1808. Meanwhile, the value of imports fell from  $85 million  in 1807 to  $45 million  in 1808 a a decline of nearly 50 percent.   Weare\\n not there yet. Except for international travel, the shutdown underway \\nin the U.S. and European economies now is largely domestic. Any effect \\non trade we are likely to see is a secondary effect of economies closing\\n down temporarily rather than the borders being closed to cargo.   That doesnat mean, though, that in an age of rising \\nprotectionism and populist economic nationalism with a pandemic rattling\\n the world the economic costs couldnat soar even further.        Early South Korea trade figures for March showed  surprising resilience \\n in exports before the full brunt of the coronavirus hit. \\nShipment\\xa0during the first 20 days of the month rose 10% from a year\\n earlier, the Korea Customs Service said Monday. The period had an extra\\n 1.5 working days in the period compared with 2019. Without that, the \\nresult would have been just about flat.      Donat keep it to yourself.

NAB is moving its staff from regional towns into busier, metropolitan branches to cope with staff shortages.

Almost all banks are openly encouraging \\ncustomers to use their dedicated apps or discuss their issues over the \\nphone instead of physically coming into branches so social distancing \\ncan be maintained.   Nab has been forced to compile staff into its venues that attract the most traffic   The Commonwealth Bank said  \\xa0it was experiencing similar issues and had to close seven of its 900 branches due to staffing issues.   'The\\n key issue for us at the moment is working through the numbers of our \\nstaff who have to take on carers' duties in the event schools are closed\\n and children have to be at home,' a spokesperson said.   'Under that scenario it may be necessary for us to close a very small number of branches.'   Westpac told\\xa0told  Australian Financial Review \\xa0it\\n previously closed branches based at\\xa0Monash University and La Trobe\\n University but are also expected to shut venues due to staffing issues.

Nextdoor \\nis an app designed to bring neighbourhoods together and provide a way \\nfor people to post jobs, safety tips or event information within the \\ncommunity.

Local\\n communities on traditional social media platforms are also banding \\ntogether to help one another online through groups such as Love Your \\nNeighbour Melbourne on Facebook.   The group was set up as Victorians started to feel the impact of the coronavirus and already has nearly 7000 members.   Their work includes volunteering to safely support the community and sharing essential items.

Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to \\nreproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses \\nare named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they\\n are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.   The \\ncoronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this \\noutbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on\\n Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory \\nSyndrome coronavirus 2.   Experts say the bug, which has killed \\naround one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a \\n'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named \\nafter it.   The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.   Dr\\n Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a \\nfamily of viruses that infect a wide range of different species \\nincluding humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild \\nanimals.\\xa0   'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there \\nwere only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of \\nthese cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has \\nbeen the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and \\nresult in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \\nand Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).\\xa0   'Coronaviruses\\n are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another \\nand that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new \\ncoronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet \\nknown.'\\xa0    The first human cases were publicly reported \\nfrom the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people \\nlive, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on \\nDecember 31.     By January 8, 59 suspected cases had \\nbeen reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were \\ndeveloped for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.     The\\n first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 \\ncases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 \\npeople had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.\\xa0     Where does the virus come from?    According\\n to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from \\nbats.\\xa0Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals a the \\nsimilar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet \\ncats and camels, respectively.   The first cases of COVID-19 came \\nfrom people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which \\nhas since been closed down for investigation.   Although the market \\nis officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being\\n sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, \\nporcupines and camel meat.\\xa0   A study by the\\xa0Wuhan \\nInstitute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific \\njournal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in \\npatients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found \\nin bats.   However, there were not many bats at the market so \\nscientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a \\nmiddle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a \\nhuman. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.   Dr\\n Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not \\ninvolved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places \\nthe origin of nCoV in bats in China.   'We still do not know whether\\n another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, \\nand possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host \\nmight have been.'\\xa0\\xa0    So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?\\xa0    Experts\\n say the international community is concerned about the virus because so\\n little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.   It\\n is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 \\nin an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus \\nwhich infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which\\n killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for\\n COVID-19.   Another reason for concern is that nobody has any \\nimmunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This \\nmeans it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across \\noften, like the flu or common cold.   Speaking at a briefing in \\nJanuary, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel \\nviruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which\\n circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.   'Most\\n seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in \\n1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand\\n fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate \\ncould be as high as two per cent.'   If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.\\xa0   'My\\n feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this \\niceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.   'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'    How does the virus spread?    The\\n illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, \\nmaking it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even\\n before someone has symptoms.   It is believed to travel in the \\nsaliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, \\nkissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live\\n on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning \\npeople can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.   Originally,\\n people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in \\nWuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been \\nthere, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to \\nperson.\\xa0    What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?    Once\\n someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 \\ndays, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms a but they may still\\n be contagious during this time.   If and when they do become ill, \\ntypical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever \\n(high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from \\nthese without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.   In\\n a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those \\nwith long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an \\ninfection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with \\nfluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left \\nuntreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.   Figures are showing \\nthat young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the\\n virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to \\nflu, but it is not clear why.\\xa0      What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?   \\xa0     Scientists\\n in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of \\nthe virus and released them to experts working around the world.\\xa0   This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   Examinations\\n have revealed the coronavirus did not change much a changing is known \\nas mutating a much during the early stages of its spread.   However,\\n the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and \\nPrevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it \\nspread through people.   This means efforts to study the virus and \\nto potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus \\nmight look different every time scientists analyse it.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   More\\n study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small \\nnumber of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were\\n various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed \\nseparately.    How dangerous is the virus?\\xa0\\xa0    The\\n virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death \\nrate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around \\n50million people.   Experts have been conflicted since the beginning\\n of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are \\ninfected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded \\ncases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they \\nnever even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more \\nserious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it \\nreally is.   However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.   Dr\\n Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a \\nmission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only \\nshowing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be \\naccurate,  Stat News  reported.    Can the virus be cured? \\xa0   The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.   Antibiotics\\n do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral\\n drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then \\ndeveloping and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge \\namounts of money.   No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and \\nit's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this \\noutbreak, for similar reasons to the above.   The National \\nInstitutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, \\nsay they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about \\ncoronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But \\nthis may take a year or more to develop, according to  Pharmaceutical Technology .   Currently,\\n governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and\\n to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.   People\\n who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their \\nsymptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected \\npublic.   And airports around the world are putting in place \\nscreening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's \\ntemperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot \\nthose who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).   However,\\n it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small \\nlikelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.    Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0   The\\n outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by \\nthe World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new \\ndisease'.\\xa0   Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside \\nof Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't \\nactually spreading actively around the world.  \", '  Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.

Most\\n last-minute customers were not asking for Corona bottles or other \\nCOVID-19 mementos but Instagram is already filled with tattoos featuring\\n those themes.   Owners had no idea when they would be able to \\nreopen, with workers at one studio considering whether they should \\ndonate its medical supplies to a hospital.\\xa0   Vic Market Tattoo Shop in Melbourne's CBD, which has seven artists including Wade Johnston, closed on Monday ahead of the ban.

'We\\n had at least five separate cases of backpackers who had just gotten off\\n international flights wanting to get tattooed, obviously ignoring \\nself-isolation guidelines.'   All foreign nationals who arrived in Australia before 9pm last Friday have been ordered to self-isolate for 14 days.   Coronavirus\\n tattoos have been appearing since the outbreak of the disease became \\nglobal news.\\xa0Corona beer bottles have been a popular COVID-19   After that time only Australian citizens, residents and immediate families have been allowed to enter the country.   Like\\n other studio operators Mr Johnston said the Australian tattoo industry \\nwas already highly regulated and followed safe cross-contamination \\npractices.   'So I'd say the industry, as a whole, takes this pretty seriously.'   This\\n studio had tourists wanting tattoos when they should be in quarantine. \\n'We had at least five separate cases of backpackers who had just gotten \\noff international flights wanting to get tattooed, obviously ignoring \\nself isolation guidelines,' artist Wade Johnston said   Jamie \\nKirchen, who owns Hunter and Fox Tattoo at Beaconsfield in Sydney's \\ninner southern suburbs, said he faced Wednesday night with a 'heavy \\nheart'.   'I didn't get home to my family until 1.30am as I live on the south coast and chose to tattoo until I could,' Mr Kirchen said.   'All\\n our artists managed to stay until cut-off time last night, fitting in \\nour loyal customers before we had to close the doors.'

'This is our \\nlivelihood. I have kids to feed and a mortgage to pay, without work this\\n will be tricky so it was a bittersweet night.   'It was great to \\nsee our clients flocking in to get their appointments met before we shut\\n down but a sickening feeling for the unknown.   'Our adrenaline was\\n pumping the whole time, posting on social media to get clients in \\nbefore 12am - emails, phone calls - but at the same time trying to limit\\n crowds by adhering to one person per every four square metres.'  \", \" Victoria and New South Wales could both go into lockdown as early as this weekend if the  coronavirus  crisis continues to deepen and  Scott Morrison 's restrictions don't flatten the curve.\\xa0   The\\n two states have the highest infection rates in the country, with \\nconfirmed cases in NSW exploding to 1,405 on Friday - almost half the \\nnational total of 3,112.

If you decide to ignore a direction, you will be \\ncaught, and you may very well find yourself slapped with a hefty fine,' \\nMinister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott said in a \\nstatement on Thursday.   'The fact that people are still not complying is the reason why we have police out in full force enforcing these directions.   'This behaviour is not only reckless and stupid, but potentially deadly.'   \\xa0On\\n Wednesday night, the government were due to discuss\\xa0'stage three' \\nrestrictions in a national cabinet meeting.\\xa0\\xa0   Nobody \\nknows exactly what the next stage will entail - but experts have told \\nDaily Mail Australia that more extreme social distancing measures are \\ninevitable.   'Distancing can be more extreme and restrictions can \\nbe made tougher. Watch this space,' said Stephen Leeder, a Professor of \\nPublic Health at Sydney University.    Schools\\xa0    Prime\\n Minister Scott Morrison said that he wants schools to stay open so \\nessential workers do not have to worry about childcare and children can \\ncontinue their education.   He said the health risk of keeping \\nschools open was low because young people are not vulnerable to \\ncoronavirus - but some teachers fear they are 'cannon fodder' and want \\nthe gates closed for their own safety.   \\xa0Paul Komesaroff, \\nProfessor of Medicine at Monash University, told Daily Mail Australia \\nthat closing the schools would be a logical step.   'The next thing \\nto do is to close schools and universities,' he said. 'But that is a big\\n step because it may impact whether parents can go to work.'   In \\nNorway and the UK, schools have been kept open for the children of \\nessential workers such as doctors and nurses and something similar could\\n be arranged in Australia.   Restaurants, cafes and food \\ncourts will be restricted to takeaway service only. Pictured: An empty \\ndining area in the once busy strip of restaurants Barangaroo\\xa0   Some states are already moving towards closing schools by bringing forward holidays.   Tasmania's school term will end four days early so teachers can prepare online education resources.   Victoria\\n has also closed its schools early, sending 1million pupils home three \\ndays before the Easter break which starts this Friday in the state.   Meanwhile,\\n the NSW Teachers Federation is calling for a planned transition to \\nonline learning across all state schools as attendance numbers continue \\nto fall due to coronavirus fears.    Businesses\\xa0    On\\n Tuesday night, Mr Morrison announced a raft of businesses that would \\nneed to close their doors, putting thousands of Australians out of work.   Personal\\n service businesses 'where there is a lot of contact', such as beauty \\ntherapy, tanning, waxing, nail salons and tattoo parlours will be forced\\n to shut.\\xa0   Personal service businesses 'where there is\\n a lot of contact', such as beauty therapy, tanning, waxing, nail salons\\n and tattoo parlours are being forced to shut   But \\nhairdressers and barbershops are allowed to remain open as well as food \\nmarkets and shopping centres, except for the food courts.   These businesses could be in the firing line if the government moves further towards a lock down.   In\\n an extreme scenario, only critical businesses such as petrol stations, \\npharmacies and grocery stores would need to remain open.    \\xa0Exercise    Mr Morrison announced on Tuesday that social sports such as large groups of people playing soccer in a park have been banned.   But he said that boot camps and personal training will be allowed to go ahead with less then 10 people.   Yoga\\n and barre sessions, as well as spinning and other exercise sessions, \\ncan continue so long as they abide by the 10 people or fewer rule as \\nwell.\\xa0   These types of exercise classes could be next on the chopping block.   Professor Komesaroff said Australia could eventually follow the lead of other countries and ban group exercise outside the home.   'We could see rules where you are only allowed out of your home for a run. Or maybe we won't even be allowed out as in China.'   Gym\\n goers are training outside after fitness clubs and recreation centres \\nwere force to shut under new coronavirus health measures.\\xa0Professor\\n Komesaroff said Australia could eventually follow the lead of other \\ncountries and ban all exercise outside the home   He added: 'I\\n personally can't see a problem with some-one running on the street \\nalone because there's no risk of transmission if they are not in a \\ngroup.'    Shopping\\xa0    Grocery shops will always stay open because people need to buy food.   But there could be limits imposed on the number of people allowed in a supermarket at one time.   Shops\\n could also require customers to better observe social distancing by \\nlimiting the number of people in aisles and making them stand two metres\\n apart.\\xa0   In Italy, for example, shoppers are forced to wait in 'socially distanced' queues just to go to the supermarket.   'Supermarkets need to have social distancing,' Professor Komesaroff said.   'They\\n might limit the number of people and have them two metres apart when \\nthey queue. That kind of process is inevitable,' he said.    Gatherings\\xa0    In Italy, for example, shoppers are forced to wait in 'socially distanced' queues just to go to the supermarket.

'They\\n might limit the number of people and have them two metres apart when \\nthey queue. That kind of process is inevitable,' he said.\\xa0   Professor Komesaroff said such measures would help slow the spread of the coronavirus.   'We're\\n right at the start of a catastrophic upsurge and we know that the \\ninfection numbers will increase drastically,' he warned.   'The minute the health service overwhelms, the death rate will increase dramatically. I don't think we can be overconfident.'   He\\n said a requirement for people to show police a letter explaining why \\nthey have left home would likely be considered in the final stage of \\nmeasures - not in stage three.  \", \" Some of Australia's wealthiest suburbs are  coronavirus  hotspots after residents brought the virus back on first class flights, luxury cruises and a skiing trip to Aspen.\\xa0\\xa0   As\\n of Friday morning, 93 of Victoria's 520 confirmed cases were\\xa0in \\nthe affluent areas of Stonnington and the Mornington Peninsula, The \\nAustralian reported.\\xa0   Wealthy suburbs Toorak and South Yarra \\nare in Stonnington, while the seaside havens of Portsea and Sorrento, \\nwhere the rich have their holiday homes, are on\\xa0 the Mornington Peninsula.\\xa0    Aspen, Colorado, is the ski resort of the rich and famous, popular among the wealthy Toorak-Portsea set (stock image)    Toorak-Portsea\\n residents are fond of skiing in Aspen, Colorado, which has \\nunfortunately now resulted in a cluster of cases from an exclusive Aspen\\n Ski resort.\\xa0     Victorian health authorities have \\nbeen monitoring the Colorado ski trip cluster, with dozens of \\nAinfections believed to have stemmed from one group visit.

On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron warned EU member states that the coronavirus crisis  may shatter the pillars of the bloc  and bring an end to the no-border Schengen Zone unless the countries in the union demonstrate solidarity.   \"Whatas at stake is the survival of the European project\", Macron \\ntold his fellow EU leaders during a conference call on 26 March. \"The \\nrisk we are facing is the death of Schengen\".   On 17 March, European leaders announced that they had agreed to shut \\nthe EUas external borders down for 30 days in a bid to slow the \\ncoronavirus spread. However, 14 of the bloc\\'s 27 members have closed \\ntheir internal borders either completely or partially thus throwing the \\nEU no-border concept into question.   Likewise, EU member states have failed to reach a compromise on \\ndebt-sharing amid the COVID-19-driven economic slowdown. Nine EU \\ncountries, namely, Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, \\nPortugal, Greece, and Slovenia are urging the union to issue so-called \\n\"corona bonds\", i.e. a common debt instrument aimed at raising funds on \\nthe market. The so-called \"Frugal Four\" - Germany, the Netherlands, \\nAustria, and Finland\\xa0 are resisting the measure.   aObservers are  sounding \\xa0the\\n alarm over the unfolding split within the Eurozone, suggesting that \\nthough the 2008 financial crisis fell short of axing the bloc\\'s common \\ncurrency the coronavirus crisis might end with the breakup of the EU.   Paolo Raffone, a strategic analyst and director of the CIPI \\nFoundation in Brussels, warns that the collapse of the Schengen \\nagreement will have \"a tremendous negative impact on citizensa lives and\\n economic sectors\".   The CIPI director feels that the 2008 crisis \"has never really ended,\\n but it has structurally created a deep divide between the countries \\nthat ought to live in solidarity, cooperation, and growth\".   According to the strategic analyst, on 26 March, 27 EU member states \\n\"practically certified the failure of the basic principles and pillars \\nof the EU integration process\".   \"Germany, followed by the Netherlands and almost all former eastern \\nbloc states, has decided to take, as the French newspaper \\'Liberation\\' \\nwrote, its \\'pound of flesh\\', that is to say to make Southern Europe pay \\nthe debts,  Italy in the lead \", he underscores.   And this is happening at a time when Italy,  one of the most-affected nations \\n in the world in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic, is struggling to stay \\nafloat. Raffone draws attention to the fact that while Germany \"produces\\n and has tens of thousands of respiratory fans and the ability to do \\n360,000 tests on the virus per week\", it is not sharing this capacity \\nwith other EU nations. \"It is the most selfish enduring asymmetry ever!\"\\n argues the strategic analyst.   For his part, Dr Giovanni Di Lieto, lecturer in international \\nbusiness and economics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, \\nbelieves that the European Union is now at the \"make it or break it\" \\nmoment.   According to Di Lieto it won\\'t happen overnight but cracks between \\nNordic European countries and their Southern and Mediterranean \\nneighbours have already appeared. He does not rule out that the latter \\nwill start to create their own fiscal bonds, fiscal credits.   \"This essentially would create a separate currency, parallel currency\\n to the euro, and it\\'s pretty much the first step to having an exit of \\nItaly from euro, the single currency\", he foresees.   On the other hand, the gradual breakup of the union may manifest \\nitself in the loss of relevance of European treaties: \"So, in the short \\nterm we are going to go back to pre-Maastricht trade state in the \\nEuropean region and then probably we won\\'t be talking any more of the \\nEuropean Union\", the lecturer alleges.   In the medium-term perspective one may expect an emergence of a \\nFrench-led bloc across the Mediterranean and Western side of Europe and \\nalso a German-led block across Northern Europe with possibly even Nordic\\n countries going their own way, according to the scholar.   \"A fair scenario could be that really all individual countries will \\ngo on their own, both economically, strategically and eventually also \\nformally, in terms of national boundaries\", he says.   \"Now I don\\'t see this happening, to be honest\", he adds.   \\n            \\n                The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.\\n            \\n          ', ' Paula Caligiuri, Northeastern University   (The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)   Paula Caligiuri, Northeastern University and Helen De Cieri, Monash University   (THE CONVERSATION) The coronavirus pandemic has forced \\ntens of millions of employees across the U.S. to work from home. While \\nthis will save lives by limiting the transmission of COVID-19, it also \\nposes significant challenges for employeesa well-being.   How can companies support the health of their employees a\\n many of whom have never before worked from home for a significant \\namount of time?   As researchers in the area of human resource management, \\nwe have studied companiesa ability to adopt and encourage practices to \\nimprove employeesa well-being.   Here are four research-backed ways we believe companies can promote employeesa health and well-being during this crisis.   1. Provide more flexibility   Before the pandemic, only about 5% of the U.S. workforce worked from home on a regular basis.   But working from home affects every employee differently \\ndepending on their responsibilities and living situations. For example, \\nwith widespread school and childcare closures, workers with younger \\nchildren need to balance keeping them occupied while trying to keep up \\nwith work tasks. And the same goes for those with elder-care \\nresponsibilities.   Thatas why employer flexibility to match specific employee needs is crucial.   A good step is for companies to require managers to have \\nopen conversations with their employees about how and when work can be \\naccomplished a without intruding on employeesa privacy a and offer a \\nwider range of options for flexibility, such as more leeway when \\nassignments need to be turned in or adjusting work hours per day to \\nallow more time to care for children and others.   Itas also important for this order to come from the top because not all managers view flexibility positively.   For workers in states where they can still head to the \\noffice, companies should also offer more flexibility, such as reduced \\nhours, a compressed  work week or even a leave of absence.   And employees should not be passive. Let your managers \\nknow what kinds of flexibility you need to balance your work and home \\nlives.   2. Encourage and host virtual social time   For workers who have never worked from home, social \\nisolation will be deeply felt. Itas hard to replicate daily interactions\\n with co-workers, casual encounters by the water cooler or after-work \\ndrinks.   Research has found that having such reciprocal, \\nsupportive interactions with work colleagues is linked to worker \\nwell-being. But companies should not assume this will happen naturally, \\nespecially when people are feeling down.   Employers should encourage their workers to find time to \\nhave virtual coffees, lunches or even happy hours with their colleagues.\\n And managers could continue to mark birthdays or other milestones with \\nvideo conference calls and other methods.   Another idea is to sponsor group games a such as Quiz \\nBreaker, Water Cooler Trivia or Wonder Polls a that employees can play \\ntogether for some downtime.   3. Train for online collaboration   Itas easy to presume that employees will be effective \\nworking remotely as long as they have the right technological tools, \\nsuch as video cameras and chatting software.   But research has found itas not that simple, and \\nconflicts can emerge as a result of the different ways people prefer to \\ncommunicate and use technology. Some workers may prefer communicating \\nover email, while others react most quickly to chat programs like Slack.\\n For others, the best way to reach them is with an old-fashioned phone \\ncall. Some of our own work has found that remote work can exacerbate the\\n problem, particularly in times of stress.   To address this, companies can offer web-based sessions \\non the most effective ways to work online. During these sessions, \\nleaders can establish ground rules for the use of collaborative \\ntechnology and build awareness of individual and cultural differences in\\n communication, including preferences for email, phone calls and \\nconference calls.   4. Foster positive coping   The pandemic is increasing peopleas fear and stress levels, which can have fatal consequences.   The National Suicide Prevention Hotline has experienced \\nan unprecedented jump in calls and even chatbot counseling apps have \\nseen an uptick in recent weeks.   Our research has shown that people use a wide variety of \\ncoping strategies when they are in a new and stressful situations. Some,\\n such as increased alcohol consumption, are not very healthy.   In normal times, companies can offer a variety of ways to\\n support employee mental and physical health, from social activities to \\ngym memberships. But with workers at home and the fitness centers \\nclosed, companies need to redirect their efforts to foster employee \\nwell-being.   Fortunately, there are plenty of apps and websites that \\ncan act as temporary substitutions. Employers can help by directing \\ntheir employees to the ones theyave vetted a and offering to foot the \\nbill.   Weave found that practicing mindfulness a focusing your \\nattention to be fully present in the moment a can be especially \\nbeneficial to employeesa mental health, even among highly stressed \\nnurses and other health care workers. Companies can help a and some \\nalready are a by offering tutorials on mindfulness, webinars on \\nresilience, reminding workers of their employee assistance programs or \\nsimply suggesting workers go for a walk.   Consistent and clear communication about health risks, \\npreventative measures and available resources is the best way for \\ncompany leaders to keep their employees safe and foster well-being \\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HUMIDITY AND FLU   *\\n At humidity levels of 23 per cent, up to 77 per cent of flu virus \\nparticles coughed into a room were still able to cause an infection an \\nhour later, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention.   * When humidity levels were raised to 43 per cent, \\njust 14 per cent of the virus particles had the ability to infect. Most \\nbecame inactive 15 minutes after being released into the humid air.   WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HUMIDITY AND COVID-19   *\\n Data collected by China\\'s Nanjing University from more than 500 \\nlocations across the globe between January 20 and March 11 suggests \\nweather including relative humidity is a factor in the spread of the \\ncontagion.   * Researchers from Madrid\\'s National Museum of Natural\\n Sciences and the University of Helsinki are reporting that tropical \\nparts of the globe seem least affected by the pandemic.   WHAT OUR EXPERTS SAY   *\\n \"I think the data is relatively strong for influenza so it could \\npotentially be the same and (what we know) could help. But I\\'d be \\ncautious.\" Professor Michael Beard, deputy director Adelaide University \\nResearch Centre for Infectious Disease   * \"It\\'s been an issue \\nthat\\'s important enough to think through in terms of the flu virus so \\nthere\\'s no reason why one wouldn\\'t pursue it in relation to the \\ncoronavirus.\" Professor Paul Komesaroff Monash University     Advertisement    ', '    Published:    10:20 AEDT, 31 March 2020     |    Updated:    10:20 AEDT, 31 March 2020        Claims\\n the spread of COVID-19 could be suppressed like influenza by regulating\\n indoor humidity need to be investigated, say Australian experts.   The\\n theory is based on 2013 research showing patients are safer from the \\nflu in a room set at higher relative humidity than a dry one.   The\\n US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found more than 75 \\nper cent of influenza particles were able to cause infection an hour \\nafter being coughed into an area where humidity levels were 23 per cent.   When the levels were raised to 43 per cent, just 14 per cent of the particles were infectious.   While\\n potentially significant, Adelaide University Research Centre for \\nInfectious Disease deputy director Michael Beard says the idea \\nhumidification might subdue COVID-19 needs analysis.   \"It seems to\\n be that this virus is a little bit hardier or a little more resistant \\nto some of the external forces that might cause it to degrade,\" he says.   \"I\\n think influenza is a lot more susceptible to changes in temperature and\\n humidty. But I think this is a really good starting point.\"   While it\\'s far from settled science, evidence has emerged that the coronavirus prefers dry conditions.   Data\\n collected by Nanjing University from more than 500 locations across the\\n globe since late January suggests weather, including relative humidity,\\n is a factor in the spread of the contagion.   Researchers from universities in Madrid and Helsinki are also reporting that tropical parts of the globe seem least affected.   That\\'s\\n enough to indicate one of the best ways to combat COVID-19 is to set \\nhumidity levels inside hospitals, schools, offices and homes between 40 \\nand 60 per cent, claims American researcher Stephanie Taylor.   \"As\\n human beings we don\\'t do well in dry air and quickly-mutating viruses \\nand bacteria do,\" says the Harvard Medical School and architecture \\ngraduate who also hosts a daily coronavirus Youtube blog.   The \\nmore moisture in the air, the harder for airborne pathogens to land \\nbeyond the 1.5m zone which constitutes our \\'personal space\\' and to keep \\nsettling and resuspending which makes surfaces hard to sterilise, she \\nsays.   They also die off faster.   At the same time, our skin\\n doesn\\'t dry and crack, our lungs better repel the pathogens that fasten\\n themselves via our airways and our organs don\\'t weaken due to \\ndehydration.

This\\n male, named Maratus constellatus, is no more than four millimeters in \\nlength and was spotted in the Little Desert National Park.   The \\ncolorful arachnid is one of seven new species of Peacock spiders, which \\nare tiny, harmless creatures that are usually smaller than a grain of \\nrice.   The new species were discovered by Joseph Schubert of  Australia's Museums Victoria , who has spent the past few years studying the Peacock spider.    Scroll down for video\\xa0    A\\n spider that resembles Vincent van Gogh's famous 'Starry Night' painting\\n has been discovered in Australia. This male, named Maratus \\nconstellatus, is no more than four millimeters in length and was spotted\\n in the Little Desert National Park   Pictured is Vincent van Gogh's famous painting 'Starry Night'   'Last\\n year I traveled the country collecting specimens of these new peacock \\nspiders (some discovered by citizen scientists!) and spent countless \\nhours in the lab studying them,' Schubert tweeted on March 26. 'Some \\nwelcome news in tough times.'   The tiny Peacock spiders, or Maratus\\n spiders, are native to Australia and are internet sensations for their \\nelaborate courtship dances.   The spider, which has similar patterns\\n to 'Starry Night,' is Maratus constellatus and was discovered in \\nWestern Australia, along with four other colorful species a Maratus \\nazureus, Maratus inaquosus, Maratus laurenae, Maratus volpei, Maratus \\nnoggerup and Maratus suae.   Maratus volpei, was discovered in South Australia and Maratus inaquosus was identified in Victoria, bringing the total to seven.   The\\n spider, which has similar patterns to 'Starry Night,' is Maratus \\nconstellatus (top right) and was discovered in Western Australia, along \\nwith four other colorful species a Maratus azureus (second on the \\nbottom),\\xa0Maratus inaquosus (third on the bottom),\\xa0Maratus \\nvolpei (bottom left) Maratus laurenae, Maratus noggerup (top left) and \\nMaratus suae (middle at the top)   The new species were named by spider taxonomist Joseph Schubert (pictured)   Schubert has described a total of 12 species of Peacock spiders since 2019 where he discovered five new ones.   'I\\n would have to say Maratus constellatus is my favorite by far - it's \\nsuch a nice looking species, the pattern reminds me of The Starry Night \\nby Van Gogh. Plus I travelled a very, very long way to find it,' he \\nexplained.   The five species Schubert discovered in 2019 are known \\nas as Maratus aquilus, Maratus felinus, and Maratus combustus, each \\nidentifiable by their distinctive patterns.\\xa0   The Monash \\nUniversity research assistant made the discovery with a group of \\nphotographers from Project Maratus at Lake Jasper and Mount Romance in \\nWestern Australia's south-west.   He says arachnophobes have no reason to fear creepy critters.   'These little guys are completely harmless! They're roughly the length of a grain of rice,' Mr\\xa0Schubert tweeted last year.   The\\n five species Schubert discovered in 2019 are known as as Maratus \\naquilus, Maratus felinus, and Maratus combustus, each identifiable by \\ntheir distinctive patterns The Maratus felinus peacock spider (pictured)\\n can be identified by its cat like features   He told  10 daily :\\xa0'They're incredibly, small but so charismatic and so colourful.'   In\\n his research findings, which were published in international scientific\\n journal Zootaxa this week, Mr Schubert said each of the new species can\\n be identified by the different markings on their abdomen.   The aquilus species refers to markings on the spider resembling an eagle's face seen from the front.   The felinus species has markings that resemble a cat.   The combustus species was named after its 'fiery explosion' pattern.   'These\\n little guys are completely harmless,'\\xa0spider taxonomist Joseph \\nSchubert said. Pictured is the\\xa0Maratus aquilus, named for its eagle\\n like markings on the abdomen   The new species call Western\\xa0 Australia's south-west home. Pictured is the\\xa0Maratus combustus   Around 60 of the 74 peacock spider species have been discovered in the past 10 years, according to\\xa0Mr Schubert's  research findings .   'This\\n interest is driven by the unique courtship behaviour of the males of \\nmost species which display an elevated and often vibrantly coloured \\nopisthosoma and third pair of legs to nearby females,' the report \\nstates.   Of all the peacock spider species, almost half can only be found in Western Australia's south-west.   'The\\n Southwest Australia ecoregion is known as one of the planet's major \\nbiodiversity hotspots and a hotspot for peacock spider diversity,' Mr \\nSchubert's report states.\\xa0  \"]\n"
